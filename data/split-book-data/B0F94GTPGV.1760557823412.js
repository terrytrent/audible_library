His fellow Calamities, enraged that he’d forgotten them, have fused their worlds together in a fit of petty rage.</p> <p>Now, everyone's stuck in a bizarre and dangerous hellscape with corruption overflowing from every dungeon. The strength I’ve gathered isn’t enough. We must rebuild what they have destroyed and raise an army of our own if we ever want to have a chance of fighting back and establish order to this world. And maybe, between the wild transformations and corrupted monster buffets, Chester and I can figure out the truth behind his mysterious past.</p>";
