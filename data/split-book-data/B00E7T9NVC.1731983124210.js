window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A popular question in philosophy is \"How do I know I exist?\" That seems really boring, though. How about, \"How can I use logic to get over my ex?\" If you really love wisdom, you love it in all situations - you don't need to be spoon fed unsolved problems in philosophy, because you're already analyzing the <i>US Weekly</i> you’re reading or your kinda significant other. Sarah Heuer and Chrissy Stockton are writers living in Minneapolis who are determined to do something more interesting with their philosophy degrees than talk about dead white guys. <i>PhiLOLZophy: Critical Thinking in Digestible Doses</i> helps its listeners think critically about vodka, religion, and sex - proving that brains do have more fun.</p>";
