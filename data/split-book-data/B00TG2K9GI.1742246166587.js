window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In <i>The Case for Grace</i>, best-selling author Lee Strobel offers an accessible explanation of the theology of God's grace - shown through incredible, dramatic, can't-put-it-down stories of people whose lives were changed.</p> <p>In this audiobook, you'll encounter racists, addicts, and even murderers who have found new hope and purpose. You'll meet once-bitter people who have received God's power to forgive those who have harmed them - and, equally amazing, people mired in guilt who have discovered that they can even forgive themselves.</p> <p>Writing with unusual candor, Lee draws upon his own journey from atheism to Christianity to explore the depth and breadth of God's redeeming love for spiritually wayward people. He travels thousands of miles to capture the inspiring stories of everyday people whose values have been radically changed and who have discovered the \"how\" and \"why\" behind God's amazing grace.</p> <p>Through it all, you will be encouraged as you see how God's grace can revolutionize your eternity and relationships...starting today.</p> <p>Also available: <i>The Case for Grace </i>Spanish edition, kids' edition, and student edition. Plus, be sure to check out Lee Strobel's entire collection of Case for...books:</p> <ul> <li><i>The Case for Christ</i> investigates the historical evidence for Jesus</li> <li><i>The Case for a Creator</i> explores the scientific evidence for God</li> <li><i>The Case for Faith</i> responds to eight major objections about Christianity</li> <li>And more!</li> </ul>";
