But there's a big problem. Janner's little brother--heir to the throne of Anniera--has grown a tail. And gray fur. Not to mention two pointed ears and long, dangerous fangs. To the suspicious folk of the Green Hollows, he looks like a monster.<br><br> But Janner knows better. His brother isn't as scary as he looks. He's perfectly harmless. Isn't he?<br><br> Full of characters rich in heart, smarts, and courage, <i>The Monster in the Hollows</i> is a tale children of all ages will cherish, families can listen to together, and book clubs are sure to enjoy discussing for its many layers of meaning.";
