window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Willie Nelson shares his life story in this \"heartfelt\" best-selling memoir of true love, wild times, best friends, and barrooms (<i>Washington Post</i>).</p> <p>\"Unvarnished. Funny. Leaving no stone unturned\"...So say the publishers about this audiobook I've written. What I say is that this is the story of my life, told as clear as a Texas sky and in the same rhythm that I lived it. It's a story of restlessness and the purity of the moment and living right. Of my childhood in Abbott, Texas, to the Pacific Northwest, from Nashville to Hawaii, and all the way back again. Of selling vacuum cleaners and encyclopedias while hosting radio shows and writing song after song, hoping to strike gold. It's a story of true love, wild times, best friends, and barrooms, with a musical sound track ripping right through it. My life gets lived on the road, at home, and on the road again, tried and true, and I've written it all down from my heart to yours. Signed, Willie Nelson.</p>";
