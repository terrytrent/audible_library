window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Satan has made a new demon, and he's a doozy, maybe the most powerful ever created. There's just one problem: this freshly-minted hellion isn't sure he wants the job. </p> <p>In the wacky final volume of the Circles in Hell series, Steve Minion attends Beast Barracks, where he learns both the arcane and mundane arts of being a servant of the Devil. Strength, speed, and endurance are all part of a demon's physical makeup, but he must be taught to be sneaky, cruel, and ruthless and of course to ignore personal hygiene. </p> <p>As Steve begins work as a full-fledged bad guy, he must confront the inevitable: demons exist to torment the damned, and Hell's former handyman-in-chief doesn't seem to have the stomach for the work. </p> <p>Still, there's no alternative for our hero. Once a demon, always a demon, as the saying goes. Steve's stuck in his new role, but really, what good to anyone is a reluctant demon? </p>";
