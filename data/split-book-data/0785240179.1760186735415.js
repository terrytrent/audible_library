window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A high-stakes quest for the Ark of the Covenant. An assassin out to stop them. And a man named Caleb, whose supernatural powers may be the only thing that can save them.</b></p> <p>In this explosive sequel to <i>Blessed Child</i>, Jewish soldier-turned-archaeologist Rebecca Soloman leads a team deep into the Ethiopian desert to find the one man who may know the final resting place of the Ark of the Covenant. Such a discovery would bring hope back to her people. Her search brings excitement and danger - including unexpected love and a discovery far more powerful than even the holy artifact.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Islamic fundamentalists dispatch Ismael, their most accomplished assassin, to pursue Rebecca and the man she’s searching for. These men fear that the Ark’s discovery will compel Israel to rebuild Solomon’s temple - on the very site of their holy mosque in Jerusalem. But the man they seek is no ordinary man.</p> <p>His name is Caleb, and he, too, is on a mission - to find again the love he embraced as a child and to share that love with the world.</p> <p>Book two in the Caleb duology:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>Blessed Child</i></li> <li><i>A Man Called Blessed</i></li> </ul> <p>Book length: approximately 100,000 words</p>";
