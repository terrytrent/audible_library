window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>We're in a Beyoncé moment. The pop sensation has more fans, more fame, and more cultural influence than ever before. But what makes her so iconic? Is she really that perfect? And why do we love her so much? <i>How to Be Beyoncé</i> isn't a biography (mostly because nobody wants to get sued by someone who does everything so perfectly). Instead, it's a meditation on her place in culture, why we love her so much, and what we can learn from her image and work-ethic, so we can reach our own potential.</p>";
