window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Robert Heinlein called it \"possibly the finest science fiction novel I have ever read\". The <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> declared that \"as science fiction, <i>The Mote in God's Eye</i> is one of the most important novels ever published\". Now Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle, award-winning authors of such best sellers as <i>Footfall</i> and <i>The Legacy of Heorot,</i> return us to the Mote, and to the universe of Kevin Renner and Horace Bury, of Rod Blaine and Sally Fowler. </p> <p>There, 25 years have passed since humanity quarantined the mysterious aliens known as Moties within the confines of their own solar system. They have spent a quarter century analyzing and agonizing over the deadly threat posed by the only aliens mankind has ever encountered - a race divided into distinct biological forms, each serving a different function: Master, Mediator, Engineer, Warrior. Each supremely adapted to its task, yet doomed by millions of years of evolution to an inescapable fate. For the Moties must breed - or die. And now the fragile wall separating them and the galaxy beyond is beginning to crumble.</p>";
