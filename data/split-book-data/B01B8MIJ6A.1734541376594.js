window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A CHRONOS Files Novella</b> </p> <p>Simon Rand's life isn't exactly linear, but he's okay with that. He was older than his mother when they first met, and he's traveled pretty much everywhere the CHRONOS key can take him. Much of his childhood was spent in the 1890s on the Cyrist Farm with his friend, Kiernan Dunne, but summer vacations meant hanging out with his grandfather in the 2020s, training to be Saul Rand's right-hand man, and fixing bits of history to help build Cyrist International. </p> <p>But that's just Simon's day job. His true passion is time tourism - jumping right smack into the middle of historical events to see what really happened. Sometimes, however, simply witnessing an event can change it, and when Simon and Kiernan investigate the death of Simon's teenage obsession, Marilyn Monroe, it may just unravel the history he knows and loves. </p>";
