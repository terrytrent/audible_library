window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Before he could forge a band of elite warriors ... he had to become one himself. </b></p> <p>Brandon Webb's experiences in the world's most elite sniper corps are the stuff of legend. From his grueling years of training in Naval Special Operations to his combat tours in the Persian Gulf and Afghanistan, <i>The Red Circle</i> provides a rare and riveting look at the inner workings of the U.S. military through the eyes of a covert operations specialist. </p> <p>Yet it is Webb's distinguished second career as a lead instructor for the shadowy \"sniper cell\" and Course Manager of the Navy SEAL Sniper Program that trained some of America's finest and deadliest warriors - including Marcus Luttrell and Chris Kyle - that makes his story so compelling. Luttrell credits Webb's training with his own survival during the ill-fated 2005 Operation Redwing in Afghanistan. </p> <p>Kyle went on to become the U.S. military's top marksman, with more than 150 confirmed kills. </p> <p>From a candid chronicle of his student days, going through the sniper course himself, to his hair-raising close calls with Taliban and al Qaeda forces in the northern Afghanistan wilderness, to his vivid account of designing new sniper standards and training some of the most accomplished snipers of the 21st century, Webb provides a rare look at the making of the Special Operations warriors who are at the forefront of today's military. </p> <p>Explosive, revealing, and intelligent, <i>The Red Circle</i> provides a uniquely personal glimpse into one of the most challenging and secretive military training courses in the world. </p> <p>A portion of proceeds from this book will go towards The Red Circle Charitable Foundation, which helps families of fallen Special Operations Warriors. </p> <p>About the authors: </p> <b>Brandon Webb </b>is a former U.S. Navy SEAL; his last assignment with the SEALs was Course Manager for the elite SEAL Sniper Course, where he was instrumental in developing new curricula that trained some of the most accomplished snipers of the 21st century. Webb has received numerous distinguished service awards, including the Presidential Unit Citation and the Navy Commendation Medal with a \"V\" for \"Valor\", for his platoon's deployment to Afghanistan following the September 11 attacks. He is editor for Military.com's blog <i>Kit Up</i>, <i>SOFREP</i>'s Editor in Chief, and a frequent national media commentator on snipers and related Special Operations Forces military issues. <p></p> <p><b>John David Mann</b>, who collaborated with Webb in writing <i>The Red Circle</i>, is an award-winning author whose titles include the <i>New York Times</i> best seller <i>Flash Foresight</i> and the international best seller <i>The Go-Giver</i>. </p>";
