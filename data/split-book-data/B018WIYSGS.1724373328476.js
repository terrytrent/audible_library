window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In Lisa Gardner's second short story, after the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>The 7th Month</i>, Detective D.D. Warren takes on her most intimidating assignment yet: a fifty-minute class meant to educate a horde of bloodthirsty thriller writers on the ways of actual police work. Yet sometimes life really does imitate fiction, as D.D. takes the writers through the reality of one of her most twisted cases - a case that involves a seedy motel room, drugs, prostitution...and a severed leg. </p> <p>With Gardner's trademark suspense, sharp observations, and thrilling storytelling, <i>3 Truths and a Lie</i> is a fascinating chapter in D.D.'s storied career. </p>";
