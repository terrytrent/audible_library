window.bookSummaryJSON = "Imagine answering your cell phone one day to a male voice that gives you three minutes to confess your sin. If you don't, the madman, Slater, will blow your car to smithereens. You barely manage to exit heavy traffic and ditch the car when, precisely three minutes later, your car blows sky high. The media and police descend on the scene; your world has just changed forever. <p>So begins the nightmare that grows with progressively higher stakes. There's another phone call, another riddle. The cycle will not stop until the world discovers the secret of your sin, but you don't have a clue what that sin is. If not for Jennifer, the brilliant FBI agent working to corner Slater, you would indeed go mad.</p>";
