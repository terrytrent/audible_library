window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Centuries have passed since civilization's brush with apocalypse. The world's greatest threats have all been silenced. There is no anger, no hatred, no war. There is only perfect peace...and fear. A terrible secret was closely guarded for centuries: every single soul walking the earth, though in appearance totally normal, is actually dead, long ago genetically stripped of true humanity. </p> <p>Nine years have gone by since an unlikely hero named Rom Sebastian first discovered a secret and consumed an ancient potion of blood to bring himself back to life in <i>Forbidden</i>. Surviving against impossible odds, Rom has gathered a secret faction of followers who have also taken the blood - the first Mortals in a world that is dead. </p> <p>On the heels of <i>Forbidden</i> comes <i>Mortal</i>, the second novel in The Books of Mortals saga penned by Ted Dekker and Tosca Lee. Set in a terrifying, medieval future, where grim pageantry masks death, this tale of dark desires and staggering stakes peels back the layers of the heart for all who dare take the journey. </p> <p>The Books of Mortals are three novels, each of which stands on its own, yet all are seamlessly woven into one epic thriller. </p>";
