window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES</i></b><b> BESTSELLER • From the bestselling author of </b><b><i>The Power of Habit</i></b><b>, a fascinating exploration of what makes conversations work—and how we can all learn to be supercommunicators at work and in life</b></p> <p><b>“A winning combination of stories, studies, and guidance that might well transform the worst communicators you know into some of the best.”—Adam Grant, author of </b><b><i>Think Again</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>Hidden Potential</i></b></p> <p>Come inside a jury room as one juror leads a starkly divided room to consensus. Join a young CIA officer as he recruits a reluctant foreign agent. And sit with an accomplished surgeon as he tries, and fails, to convince yet another cancer patient to opt for the <i>less</i> risky course of treatment. In <i>Supercommunicators</i>, Charles Duhigg blends deep research and his trademark storytelling skills to show how we can all learn to identify and leverage the hidden layers that lurk beneath every conversation.</p> <p>Communication is a superpower and the best communicators understand that whenever we speak, we’re actually participating in one of three conversations: practical (<i>What’s this really about?</i>), emotional (<i>How do we feel?</i>), and social (<i>Who are we?</i>). If you don’t know what <i>kind</i> of conversation you’re having, you’re unlikely to connect.</p> <p>Supercommunicators know the importance of recognizing—and then matching—each kind of conversation, and how to hear the complex emotions, subtle negotiations, and deeply held beliefs that color so much of what we say and how we listen. Our experiences, our values, our emotional lives—and how we see ourselves, and others—shape every discussion, from who will pick up the kids to how we want to be treated at work. In this book, you will learn why some people are able to make themselves heard, and to hear others, so clearly.</p> <p>With his storytelling that takes us from the writers’ room of <i>The Big Bang Theory </i>to the couches of leading marriage counselors, Duhigg shows listeners how to recognize these three conversations—and teaches us the tips and skills we need to navigate them more successfully.</p> <p>In the end, he delivers a simple but powerful lesson: With the right tools, we can connect with anyone.</p>";
