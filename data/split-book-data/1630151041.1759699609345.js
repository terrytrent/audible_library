window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Implement a more constructive approach to difficult students </p> <p><i>Lost and Found</i> is a follow-up to Dr. Ross Greene's landmark works, <i>The Explosive Child </i>and <i>Lost at School</i>, providing educators with highly practical, explicit guidance on implementing his Collaborative &amp; Proactive Solutions (CPS) Problem Solving model with behaviorally-challenging students. While the first two books described Dr. Greene's positive, constructive approach and described implementation on a macro level, this useful guide provides the details of hands-on CPS implementation by those who interact with these children every day. Listeners will learn how to incorporate students' input in understanding the factors making it difficult for them to meet expectations and in generating mutually satisfactory solutions. Specific strategies, sample dialogues, and time-tested advice help educators implement these techniques immediately. </p> <p>The groundbreaking CPS approach has been a revelation for parents and educators of behaviorally-challenging children. This book gives educators the concrete guidance they need to immediately begin working more effectively with these students.</p>";
