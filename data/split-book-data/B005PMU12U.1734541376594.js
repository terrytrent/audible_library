window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>“Stephenson has a once-in-a-generation gift: he makes complex ideas clear, and he makes them funny, heartbreaking, and thrilling.” - <i>Time</i></p> <p>The #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Anathem</i>, Neal Stephenson is continually rocking the literary world with his brazen and brilliant fictional creations - whether he’s reimagining the past (The Baroque Cycle), inventing the future (<i>Snow Crash</i>), or both (<i>Cryptonomicon</i>). With <i>Reamde</i>, this visionary author whose mind-stretching fiction has been enthusiastically compared to the work of Thomas Pynchon, Don DeLillo, Kurt Vonnegut, and David Foster Wallace - not to mention William Gibson and Michael Crichton - once again blazes new ground with a high-stakes thriller that will enthrall his loyal audience, science and science fiction, and espionage fiction fans equally. The breathtaking tale of a wealthy tech entrepreneur caught in the very real crossfire of his own online fantasy war game, <i>Reamde</i> is a new high - and a new world - for the remarkable Neal Stephenson.</p>";
