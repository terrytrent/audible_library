Something you never take for granted. As a guild rat, he's grown up in the slums and learned to judge people quickly - and to take risks. Risks like apprenticing himself to Durzo Blint.</p> <p>But to be accepted, Azoth must turn his back on his old life and embrace a new identity and name. As Kylar Stern, he must learn to navigate the assassins' world of dangerous politics and strange magics - and cultivate a flair for death.</p> <p>Performed by Dylan Lynch, David Coyne, Eric Messner, Ren Casey, Ken Jackson, Christopher Graybill, Michael Glenn, Terence Aselford, Tim Getman, Elizabeth Jernigan, Richard Rohan, Colleen Delany, Johann Dettweiler, Thomas Penny, Joe Brack, Casie Platt, Nanette Savard, Lily Beacon, Laura Quinn, Mort Shelby, James Lewis, Scott McCormick, Yazmin Tuazon.</p>";
