It is a love story, but not one you have heard before.</b><br> <b><br> \"Delightful and absorbing.\" —</b><b><i>The New York Times </i></b><b>• \"Utterly brilliant.\" —John Green</b><br> <br> <b>One of the </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b>’s 100 Best Books of the 21st Century • One of the Best Books of the Year: </b><b><i>The New York Times, Entertainment Weekly, TIME, </i></b><b>GoodReads, </b><b><i>Oprah Daily</i></b><br> <br> From the best-selling author of <i>The Storied Life of A. J. Fikry</i>: On a bitter-cold day, in the December of his junior year at Harvard, Sam Masur exits a subway car and sees, amid the hordes of people waiting on the platform, Sadie Green. He calls her name. For a moment, she pretends she hasn’t heard him, but then, she turns, and a game begins: a legendary collaboration that will launch them to stardom. <br> <br> These friends, intimates since childhood, borrow money, beg favors, and, before even graduating college, they have created their first blockbuster, Ichigo. Overnight, the world is theirs. Not even twenty-five years old, Sam and Sadie are brilliant, successful, and rich, but these qualities won’t protect them from their own creative ambitions or the betrayals of their hearts.<br> <br> Spanning thirty years, from Cambridge, Massachusetts, to Venice Beach, California, and lands in between and far beyond, Gabrielle Zevin’s <i>Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow </i>examines the multifarious nature of identity, disability, failure, the redemptive possibilities in play, and above all, our need to connect: to be loved and to love.</p>";
