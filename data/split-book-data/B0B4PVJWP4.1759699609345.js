As armies begin to gather and cities seethe with tension, Mari, Alain, and their friends must prepare to confront the storm in the place it first appeared: the broken kingdom of Tiae.</p> <p>The dangers facing them demand perilous raids, tough battles, and more than a little piracy. Beating the Mechanics Guild and the Mage Guild that have controlled the world of Dematr for centuries will require an unprecedented alliance under </p> <p>Mari's command of rebellious Mechanics, Mages, and common folk who know that together they can change the world, but separately they will all lose.</p>";
