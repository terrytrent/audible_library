He's finally living the idyllic life, far from thoughts of theft and murder and other kinds of horrible criminal behavior.</p> <p>He's left his past far behind...or so he thinks.</p> <p>Ted Dekker delivers a fascinating story of the almost perfect crime, interwoven with a tale of bittersweet love that is almost enough to save a soul. A story that will bring you face-to-face with a hidden world more real than most people ever realize; a world where the unseen is more powerful than anything seen.</p> <p>\"Well, well, guess what I've found. A fiction writer with a rare knack for a compelling story, an expansive reservoir of clever ideas, and a unique dry wit that makes me laugh.\" (Frank Peretti, <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author)</p> <p>\"Rarely does a novel grip a reader's heart and soul the way <i>Heaven's Wager</i> does. Dekker is among a very small number of writers who have mastered the challenge of blending sound theology with knock-your-socks-off storytelling.\" (Robert Liparulo, novelist and contributing editor of<i> New Man</i> magazine)</p>";
