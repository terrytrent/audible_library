window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>New York Times </i></b><b>best-selling author Lee Strobel trains his investigative sights on the hot-button question: is it really credible to believe God intervenes supernaturally in people’s lives today?</b></p> <p>This provocative book starts with an unlikely interview in which America’s foremost skeptic builds a seemingly persuasive case against the miraculous. But then Strobel travels the country to quiz scholars to see whether they can offer solid answers to atheist objections. Along the way, he encounters astounding accounts of healings and other phenomena that simply cannot be explained away by naturalistic causes. The audiobook features the results of exclusive new scientific polling that shows miracle accounts are much more common than people think.</p> <p>What’s more, Strobel delves into the most controversial question of all: what about miracles that don’t happen? If God can intervene in the world, why doesn’t he do it more often to relieve suffering? Many American Christians are embarrassed by the supernatural, not wanting to look odd or extreme to their neighbors. Yet, <i>The Case for Miracles</i> shows not only that the miraculous is possible, but that God still does intervene in our world in awe-inspiring ways. Here’s a unique audiobook that examines all sides of this issue and comes away with a passionate defense for God’s divine action in lives today. </p> <p>Also available: <i>The Case for Miracles</i> - Spanish edition, kids' edition, and student edition.</p>";
