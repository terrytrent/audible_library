window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Notes from the author: The following is a short story I wrote in the Elantris world back in January of 2006. At that point, <i>Elantris </i>had been out in stores for only about seven or eight months, but I actually hadn’t written anything new on the story or world since 2000, when I’d finished the first draft of the original book.</p> <p>There were always a few holes in the manuscript where I decided not to include viewpoints or sections of explanation in the name of streamlining, particularly at the end. In the back of my mind, I knew what happened. This story talks about one of those holes; it is meant to be heard after you’ve finished the novel and takes place during the events of the climax. In the annotation, I’ve written a further explanation of why I wrote this piece. Some of you may find it interesting to hear this ahead of time; I put it in the annotation, however, as I know others would rather enjoy the story without bias beforehand, then hear my thoughts afterward. Either way, if you haven’t listened to <i>Elantris</i>, this contains major spoilers. Might I suggest listening to the book first? This story won’t work at all for you if you haven’t.</p> <p>Performed by Colleen Delany, Kimberly Gilbert, Mort Shelby, James Lewis, Richard Rohan, Michael John Casey, Danny Gavigan, Tracy Olivera, Eric Messner, Nanette Savard, Chris Davenport, Evan Casey, Scott McCormick, Ken Jackson, Timothy Lynch, Thomas Penny, Rose Elizabeth Supan.</p>";
