window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>God's astounding claims about himself and his work on our behalf are embedded throughout the pages of Scripture. He sees potential in us that we don't see in our wildest dreams. He sees qualities that we don't think we can ever achieve. He has faith in us that we lack in ourselves. But when we know and fully understand what He has promised, we are liberated to grow in virtue, live out our faith as an adventure, relate to others with authenticity, earn a living with integrity, and make a difference in our culture - all through his power.</p> <p>Lee Strobel's insights into the benefits of living as a fully devoted follower of Christ are refreshing and powerfully relevant. Using true stories, including his own, he shows that Christianity really works, that we really can live transformed, authentic, and effective lives--and that God's promises and power are very real and very true.</p>";
