window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Ex-Army paratrooper Griffin “Fin” Brooks thought he left danger behind when his battlefield injuries forced him to pursue a new career in marine biology. But one fateful night off the coast of South Africa, a ship nearly crashes into him and his loyal golden retriever, Jacques.</p> <p>Not just any ship. A starship.</p> <p>Though its alien pilot is dead, the rare extraterrestrial animal inside is not. Fin learns the creature is being smuggled across the galaxy when a pair of interstellar visitors respond to the crash. But those same investigators accuse Fin and his dog of crimes he didn’t even know existed.</p> <p>The only way to clear his name is to take the strange creature to its home planet and find out who’s responsible for killing the starship’s pilot. And that means Fin quickly needs to learn how to fly a spacecraft and navigate a galaxy teeming with intelligent life beyond his wildest dreams.</p> <p>And he’s not the only one with designs for the crashed starship and it's cargo. Fin will need every skill he’s honed as a paratrooper and a marine biologist if he—and his dog—are to survive.</p> <p>Don't miss the next rollicking sci-fi adventure from Anthony J. Melchiorri. It's perfect for fans of JN Chaney, MR Forbes, and Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.</p>";
