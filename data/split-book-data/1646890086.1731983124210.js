window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Whether you’re a Christian parent, youth leader, or educator who works with Generation Z, this book was written for you. As powerful ideas in our increasingly secular culture shape more of this generation, trusted leaders must share what they know about Jesus in ways that will reach them. But how? Backed by the latest research and first hand experience, this powerful book shows how to share biblical truth with a generation that desperately needs to hear it in a way that draws them in instead of pushing them away.</p> <p>Written by two youth influencers and experts on Generation Z, Sean McDowell, PhD, and J. Warner Wallace, <i>So the Next Generation Will Know</i> is an extraordinarily practical and relatable guide for anyone concerned with ensuring the next generation understands and embraces a biblical worldview.</p>";
