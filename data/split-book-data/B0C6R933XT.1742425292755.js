Instead, Lord Vetinari, supreme ruler of Ankh-Morpork, has made him the city’s Postmaster General. Death may be preferable to fixing the Postal Service—a creaky, outdated institution beset by eccentric employees, mountains of old, undelivered mail Moist swears is talking to him, and a dangerous secret order. To restore the postal service to its former glory, Moist accepts the help of the tough talking and very attractive activist Adora Belle Dearheart.</p> <p>But to succeed, Moist must overcome two formidable foes—new technology and the greedy chairman of a communication monopoly who will stop at nothing to delay Ankh-Morpork’s post for good . . .</p> <p>The Discworld novels can be enjoyed in any order, but <i>Going Postal</i> is the first book in the Moist von Lipwig series. The series, in order, includes:</p> <p><i>Going Postal</i></p> <p><i>Making Money</i></p> <p><i>Raising Steam</i></p>";
