window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Written by an L. A. County homicide detective and former atheist, </b><b><i>Cold-Case Christianity</i></b><b> examines the claims of the New Testament using the skills and strategies of a hard-to-convince criminal investigator. </b></p> <p>Christianity could be defined as a “cold case”: it makes a claim about an event from the distant past for which there is little forensic evidence. In <i>Cold-Case Christianity</i>, J. Warner Wallace uses his nationally recognized skills as a homicide detective to look at the evidence and eyewitnesses behind Christian beliefs. Including gripping stories from his career and the visual techniques he developed in the courtroom, Wallace uses illustration to examine the powerful evidence that validates the claims of Christianity. </p> <p>A unique apologetic that speaks to listeners’ intense interest in detective stories, <i>Cold-Case Christianity </i>inspires listeners to have confidence in Christ as it prepares them to articulate the case for Christianity.</p>";
