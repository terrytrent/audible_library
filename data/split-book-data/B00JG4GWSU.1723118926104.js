window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>\"My name is Alice Ringwald, but the man who kidnapped me says that's a lie.\"</b> </p> <p>Thirteen-year-old orphan Alice Ringwald has no memory beyond six months ago. The only life she knows is the new one she's creating one day at a time with the loving couple that recently adopted her and gave her new hope. That hope, however, is shattered one night when she is abducted by a strange man. In a frantic FBI man hunt, the kidnapper vanished with Alice. So begins <i>Water Walker</i>, a modern-day parable that examines the staggering power of forgiveness, and reminds us that it's possible to live free of the hurt that keeps our souls in chains.</p>";
