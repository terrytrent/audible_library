window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"Be strong and courageous. Do not be frightened, and do not be dismayed,</p> <p>for the LORD your God is with you wherever you go.\" (Joshua 1:9)</p> <p>Each day, you watch America turn further from Christian values and the core principles of liberty. It's frustrating to feel you can't assert biblical truth without facing condemnation, and fearful to witness outrage and victimhood replace respect and reason. Amid this dissent, how can you not only stay rooted in your own faith, but continue publicly testifying for Jesus?</p> <p>In <i>We Will Not Be Silenced</i>, Dr. Erwin W. Lutzer prepares you to live out your convictions against a growing tide of hostility. Gain a better understanding of nonbelievers' legitimate hurts and concerns regarding issues like racism, sexism, and poverty - and identify the toxic responses secular culture disguises as solutions. In the process, you'll see how you can show compassion and gentleness to those outside of the faith without affirming their beliefs.</p> <p><i>We Will Not Be Silenced</i> will ready you to move beyond fear and boldly accept the challenge of representing Christ to a watching world that needs him now more than ever before.</p>";
