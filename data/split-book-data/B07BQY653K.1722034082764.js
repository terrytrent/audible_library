window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From acclaimed author Dr. Jason Fung, a revolutionary guide to reversing diabetes. </p> <p>Dr. Jason Fung forever changed the way we think about obesity with his best-selling book, <i>The Obesity Code</i>. Now he has set out to do the same for type 2 diabetes. </p> <p>Today, most doctors, dietitians, and even diabetes specialists consider type 2 diabetes to be a chronic and progressive disease - a life sentence with no possibility of parole. But the truth, as Dr. Fung reveals in this paradigm-shifting book, is that type 2 diabetes is reversible. Writing with clear, persuasive language, he explains why conventional treatments that rely on insulin or other blood-glucose-lowering drugs can actually exacerbate the problem, leading to significant weight gain and even heart disease. The only way to treat type 2 diabetes effectively, he argues, is proper dieting and intermittent fasting - not medication. </p>";
