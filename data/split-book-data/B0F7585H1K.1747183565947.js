A piece of technology he has never seen before–and shouldn’t even exist.</p> <p>Suddenly, corpses start turning up, eco-activists go on the attack, random people suffer bizarre symptoms. And every time the authorities get a lead, it traces right back to Philip and his colleague, Celia Hunt.</p> <p>Then, a mysterious caller contacts Philip–and, suddenly, staying out of jail is the very least of his problems.</p> <p>Apparently, that hot tub’s going to have to wait.</p>";
