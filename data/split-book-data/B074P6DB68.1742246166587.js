Thanks to Martin Sheen’s performance and the voices of ordinary Americans throughout this Audible Original, listeners can feel what life was like during a disruptive and uncertain period of American history. Martha Little is the Executive Producer, and Dan Gediman is the series producer of <i>The Home Front.</i></p> <p><b>Note: </b><b><i>The Home Front</i></b><b> contains mature and sensitive themes.</b>&nbsp;</p>";
