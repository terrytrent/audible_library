window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Who am I? </i></p> <p>My name is Christy Snow. I'm 17 and I'm about to die. I'm buried in a coffin under tons of concrete. No one knows where I am. My heart sounds like a monster with clobber feet, running straight toward me. </p> <p>I'm lying on my back, soaked with sweat from the hair on my head to the soles of my feet. My hands and feet won't stop shaking. Some will say that I'm not really here. Some will say I'm delusional. Some will say that I don t even exist. But who are they? I'm the one buried in a grave. </p> <p>My name is Christy Snow. I'm 17. I'm about to die. </p> <p><i>So who are you? </i></p> <p>In a return to the kind of storytelling that made <i>Black, Showdown and Three</i> unforgettable, Ted Dekker drags that question into the light with this modern day parable about how we see ourselves. Humming with intensity and blindsided twists, <i>Eyes Wide Open</i> is raw adrenaline from the first page to the last pure escapism packed with inescapable truth. Not all is as it seems. Or is it? Strap yourself in for the ride of your life. Literally.</p>";
