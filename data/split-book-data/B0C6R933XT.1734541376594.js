window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>“[Pratchett’s] books are almost always better than they have to be, and </b><b><i>Going Postal</i></b><b> is no exception, full of nimble wordplay, devious plotting and outrageous situations, but always grounded in an astute understanding of human nature.” — </b><b><i>San Francisco Chronicle</i></b></p> <p><b>Another brilliant installment in </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling author Sir Terry Pratchett's beloved Discworld series</b>—<b>a splendid send-up of government, the postal system, and everything that lies in between. This new audiobook recording is narrated by Richard Coyle (Moist von Lipwig in the television adaptation of </b><b><i>Going Postal), </i></b><b>with Golden Globe award-winning actor</b><b><i> </i></b><b>Bill Nighy (</b><b><i>Love Actually, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</i></b><b>) reading the footnotes and Peter Serafinowicz (</b><b><i>Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace)</i></b><b> starring as the voice of Death.</b></p> <p>Suddenly, condemned arch-swindler Moist von Lipwig found himself with a noose around his neck and dropping through a trapdoor into . . . <i>a government job</i>?</p> <p>By all rights, Moist should be meeting his maker rather than being offered a position as Postmaster by Lord Vetinari, supreme ruler of Ankh-Morpork. Getting the moribund Postal Service up and running again, however, may prove an impossible task, what with literally mountains of decades-old undelivered mail clogging every nook and cranny of the broken-down post office. Worse still, Moist could swear the mail is <i>talking</i> to him. Worst of all, it means taking on the gargantuan, greedy Grand Trunk clacks communication monopoly and its bloodthirsty piratical headman. But if the bold and undoable are what's called for, Moist's the man for the job—to move the mail, continue breathing, get the girl, and specially deliver that invaluable commodity that every being, human or otherwise requires: <i>hope</i>.</p> <p>The Discworld novels can be enjoyed in any order but <i>Going Postal</i> is the 33rd Discworld book and the first in the Moist von Lipwig collection, which also includes:</p> <ul> <li><i>Making Money</i></li> <li><i>Raising Steam</i></li> </ul>";
