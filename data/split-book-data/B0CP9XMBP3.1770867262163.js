Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.<br> <br> Luke 17:28-30</b><br> <br> Mason Lot is in-house counsel for Poseidon, a major Wall Street firm that serves as a front company for the National Security State. His job pays well and gives him insight into the corrupt shadow government, but it can't help with his problems at home.<br> <br> Mason assumed that the hefty price tag for his daughter’s private school would buy him a pass from the insanity plaguing New York’s public school system. Nevertheless, indoctrinated by propaganda, Wynter wants to transition into being a boy. When Mason refuses to pay for the procedure, Wynter turns to the state for help. CPS removes her because Mason is not providing a gender-affirming environment. Mason tries to fight back through the courts but hits a dead end. With no other course of action available, Mason is forced to take alternative measures to protect his daughter.<br> <br> As if things weren’t bad enough, demand for US dollars is cut in half triggering a cascading failure in America’s currency. Prices skyrocket, markets plummet, and chaos breaks out in the streets. A charismatic aristocrat named Ange de Bourbon rides in on a white horse with a plan for a common global currency that can save the West from certain economic ruin.<br> <br> Amidst the turmoil, Mason witnesses a plane crash, several abandoned cars blocking traffic, and hears reports of people who have simply disappeared with no explanation. Social media posts, videos, and even emails discussing the strange phenomenon are quickly taken down. The media is silent about the vanishings but has no shortage of mayhem to report.</p> <p>Mason gets a call from his boss at Poseidon telling him that he should move his family out of New York City by the following day. Mason understands that his boss knows more than he’s allowed to say. He implores his wife and four daughters to get out of the city before it’s to late.<br> <br> A two-thousand-year-old prophecy has predicted a time of unparalleled tumult that will be poured out upon the earth. Over a seven-year period, God’s final judgments will rain down as sword, famine, and plague, being revealed as seven seals, seven trumpets, and seven vials of God’s wrath.<br> <br> The more Mason learns about this archaic writing by the Apostle John, the harder it is becoming for him to deny that he has been left behind. If this gauntlet of destruction is to be survived, Mason Lot will have to decipher the ancient texts, put together a plan, and pray like it’s the end of the world.</p>";
