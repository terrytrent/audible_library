window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A laugh-out-loud, slice-of-life martial-arts fantasy about . . . farming????</b></p> <p>Jin Rou wanted to be a cultivator. A man powerful enough to defy the heavens. A master of martial arts. A lord of spiritual power. Unfortunately for him, he died, and now <i>I'm</i> stuck in his body.</p> <p>Out in the middle of nowhere, I've managed to escape a life of cultivation and politics. Until now, that is. I guess it was inevitable they caught up with me eventually. I haven't exactly been subtle. You know, what with the talking animals performing heroics all over the Azure Hills and Xiulan constantly calling me a Hidden Master.</p> <p>A part of me wants to run away again. The memory of my death still haunts my dreams. But this is my home now. And I'll be <i>damned</i> if I give it up without a fight.</p> <p>I mean, all I have to do is learn how to navigate xianxia politics and train for battle while simultaneously running my farm and uncovering an ancient cataclysm that apparently destroyed the Azure Hills back in the day.</p> <p>Meanwhile, I'm about to be a father . . . Man, I'm kinda screwed, aren't I? At least I can call in the cavalry—ahem, <i>poultry</i>—to help.</p> <p><b>The fourth volume of the blockbuster progression-fantasy series—with more than 20 million views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
