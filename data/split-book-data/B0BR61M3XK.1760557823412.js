window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From the highly acclaimed author of <i>Ninety-two in the Shade</i> and <i>Cloudbursts </i>comes a collection of alternately playful and exquisite essays—including seven collected here for the first time—borne of a lifetime spent fishing.</p> <p>\"Thomas McGuane writes about fishing better than anyone else in the history of mankind.\" (Jim Harrison, <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of <i>Legends of the Fall</i>)</p> <p>The 40 extraordinary pieces in <i>The Longest Silence</i> take the listener from the tarpon of Florida to the salmon of Iceland, from the bonefish of Mexico to the trout of Montana. They introduce characters as varied as a highly literate Canadian frontiersman and a devoutly Mormon river guide and address issues ranging from the esoteric art of tying flies to the enduring philosophy of a 17th-century angler to the trials of the aging fisherman.</p> <p>Both reverent and hilarious by turns, and infused with a deep experience of wildlife and the outdoors, <i>The Longest Silence</i> sets the heart pounding for a glimpse of moving water and demonstrates what dedication to sport reveals about life.</p>";
