window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Over Jon Ryan's very long life, he's managed to make a lot of very powerful enemies.</b></p> <p>Mostly, he's accomplished this antisocial feat by exterminating them because they posed a threat to galactic peace or common decency. As with any action, there can be an equal and opposite reaction. Now, a fundamental force of existence named Xyándor is after Jon. You see, Xyándor's sole purpose is to spawn chaos. So he's dead set on killing Jon because our hero snuffs out chaos on a routine basis. Most likely, this Xyándor character must've had a really troubled childhood, right?</p> <p>But Xyándor has observed Jon for a very long time. He knows that it's right there next to impossible to kill Jon Ryan. The man's irritatingly resourceful, skilled, and lucky. So, instead of a direct confrontation, Xyándor elects to kidnap Jon's mother, Alice Ryan. He will use her to get his vengeance on Jon. Hey, here's a question for you: what do you think happens to anyone who even thinks about harming one hair on Jon's dear mother's head? Yeah, something very not good, that's what happens to that individual.</p> <p>So it's game on. Alice is missing, and Jon's going to find her if it's the last thing he ever does. The problem is that it might very well be the last thing he ever does. You see, Xyándor has a couple of outstandingly useful assets on his side. One, he's transcendentally powerful, able to manipulate the very fabric of space/time at will. And he's not actually alive. That's gonna make killing him awfully darn hard, now won't it?</p> <p>Who's your money on? Jon, because he's the lethal human that he is? Or do you favor Xyándor, an eternal lifeless demigod? Well, listen to <i>Saving Alice Ryan</i> and find out where the smart money is. You'll be so glad you did!</p>";
