Part soundscape and part bedtime story, <i>The Sleeping World</i> is an intimate journey through ecologies around the world.</p> <p>Sloths are the slowest mammals on earth. They can hardly see. They live in rainforests among jaguars, pumas, and countless other predators. Yet they survive. And they do it by being so incredibly slow, and living a life covered in algae. In this episode, we hang with a sloth in the jungle of Costa Rica as he spends a month digesting one single leaf, and we see the symbiosis and collaboration that surrounds him.</p> <p>This is the world in its natural state, defined by seasons, routines, and cycles. By the time this sloth has traversed his tree and resumed his life of rest, you’ll be ready to rest too.</p> <p><b><i>Produced by</i></b><i> Audible and Mumble Media<br> </i><b><i>Written by</i></b><i> Jake Young<br> </i><b><i>Narrated by</i></b><i> Cynthia Kimola <br> </i><b><i>Executive Producers for Mumble Media:</i></b><i> Cara Ehlenfeldt and Jake Young<br> </i><b><i>Executive Producer for Audible:</i></b><i> Anna Stitt <br> </i><b><i>Sound Design and Mix:</i></b><i> Mumble Media<br> </i><b><i>The Mumble Media team</i></b><i> is Jaymeson Catsouphes, Cara Ehlenfeldt, Chester Gwazda, Liz Mak, Lee Mengistu, Renée Vargas, and Jake Young <br> </i><b><i>Sloth Consultant:</i></b><i> Julián Monge-Nájera<br> </i><b><i>Fact-Checker:</i></b><i> Andrea López-Cruzado <br> </i><b><i>Head of Creative Development at Audible:</i></b><i> Kate Navin <br> </i><b><i>Chief Content Officer at Audible:</i></b><i> Rachel Ghiazza</i></p> <p>Available in Dolby Atmos on Audible.</p>";
