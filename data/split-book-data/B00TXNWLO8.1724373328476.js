window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The <i>New York Times</i> best-selling series based on the blockbuster XboxÂ® games! </p> <p>While Spartans get all the glory, no soldier - not even the legendary Master Chief - wins a war on his own. Gunnery Sergeant Edward Buck and his team of Orbital Drop Shock Troopers (ODSTs) played a major role in saving the Earth from all-out invasion at the end of the Covenant War - acts of bravery and ingenuity that did not go unnoticed by the United Nations Space Command. </p> <p>Now, after many Spartans have been killed in battle, and the Master Chief is listed as MIA, the UNSC decides to create a new generation of Spartans to defend humanity from threats both outside and within. When they come to Buck with an extraordinary proposition, he is forced to make a life-altering decision. With the Covenant War finally over, is it time for him finally to retire to the sidelines for a life he could only dream about...or is he prepared to step up and become part of the military's new blood?</p>";
