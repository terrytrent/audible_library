window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Experience one of the first novels from </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling author Ted Dekker.</b></p> <p><b>A thriller unlike any you have ever heard. A love strong enough to bring a tremor to your bones. A sacrifice powerful enough to make heaven weep.</b></p> <p>At the close of World War II, a shell-shocked solider, Jan Jovic, was forced to inflict a game of life and death on a peaceful Bosnian community. In a few short hours, this young man was confronted by more love - and hate - than most experience in a lifetime.</p> <p>Years later, Jan has become a world-renowned writer with widespread influence in the United States, his past buried deep in his memory. Until at the most inopportune time, the game Jan witnessed comes back to haunt him...and unwittingly leads him to a beautiful but broken woman caught in an underworld of crime.</p> <p>He must now defeat an evil rarely seen. But there is a price. One that even this war-scarred solider can't imagine.</p>";
