window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From the author of #1 bestseller <i>Morgan Is My Name</i> comes the second in the trilogy. Based on Arthurian legends, <i>Le Fay</i> is the second book in the magical retelling of Morgan Le Fay’s life.</p> <p>Having escaped an unhappy marriage, Morgan finds herself in Camelot – the city of dreams and peace. Her brother, King Arthur, treats her as a valued advisor and Morgan finally has recognition befitting her intelligence within Arthur’s trusted circle, despite a longstanding conflict with Queen Guinevere.</p> <p>But Morgan’s life is not without complications. Between a vengeful husband determined to snatch their son away, the strict ideals of court life, and a jealous rival for Arthur’s attentions in the sorcerer Merlin, gaining true recognition and freedom is a greater challenge than Morgan envisioned. And when a face from her past arrives at Camelot, bringing old memories and new desires, the future that she has planned is at greater risk than ever.</p> <p>When trouble strikes, Morgan is forced to accept an avaricious Merlin’s offer of tutorage in order to keep everything she loves safe. But as Morgan’s growing knowledge pushes the boundaries of death itself, the temptation of darkness both uncovers formidable new powers, and threatens her reputation. What sacrifices is Morgan willing to make to keep control of her life?</p>";
