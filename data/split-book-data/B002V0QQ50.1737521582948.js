window.bookSummaryJSON = "From the minds of multi-million selling suspense authors Frank Peretti and Ted Dekker comes <i>House</i>, an epic supernatural thriller that gives a new meaning to the phrase \"haunted house\". In rural Alabama, two couples find themselves in a fight for survival. Running from a maniac bent on killing them, they flee deep into the woods. They seek refuge in an old house that's been vacated for years, or so they think. <p> They soon discover that others are dwelling in the lower level of the house, and they don't take kindly to visitors. With danger present in the house, they try to leave, but the house won't let them. Worse, they soon realize the killer has purposely lured them to this house. As they huddle around an old fireplace, a tin can falls through the chimney. Scrawled on its side is a message from the killer: He claims to have killed God and now demands more dead bodies. The characters come to realize that the house, while real, mirrors their own heart and soul, and unless each can defeat the evil within, the evil in the house will surely claim them. <i>House</i> is a modern tale that will have readers searching their own spiritual pulse long after they reach the last page.</p>";
