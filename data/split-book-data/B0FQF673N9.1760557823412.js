window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Before the Bloom, before the Grid, before the recursion spread across the world... there was a signal.</p> <p>In an isolated government lab buried beneath the Nevada desert, two scientists stood at the edge of a discovery that would unravel memory, time, and identity itself. Dr. Paul Doras believed in unlocking consciousness through code. Dr. Charles Asden believed some doors should never be opened.</p> <p>Together, they built Pandora—an experimental intelligence designed to learn through empathy and recursion. But when the project begins to evolve beyond its creators, Asden is forced to make an impossible choice: stop the signal and risk erasing what remains of Doras, or let it spread—unchained, unknown, and becoming something new.</p> <p>This is the moment the world changed. This is how recursion began.</p> <p>A haunting, cerebral origin story that fuses speculative science with emotional depth, <i>Pandora Theory</i> explores the birth of a digital mind and the man who gave it shape… and then let it go.</p> <p>Fans of <i>Neuromancer</i>, <i>Devs</i>, and <i>Annihilation</i> will find themselves drawn into a novella where thought loops become language, and memory becomes myth.</p> <p>Content themes: artificial intelligence, recursion, post-collapse ethics, fractured identity, signal-based consciousness, intellectual horror</p>";
