window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A post-apocalyptic thriller of the after effects in the United States after a terrifying terrorist attack using electromagnetic pulse weapons.</p> <p>In a small North Carolina town, one man struggles to save his family after America loses a war that will send it back to the Dark Ages.</p> <p>Already cited on the floor of Congress and discussed in the corridors of the Pentagon as a book all Americans should read, <em>One Second After</em> is the story of a war scenario that could become all too terrifyingly real. Based on a real weapon—the electromagnetic pulse (EMP)—which may already be in the hands of our enemies, it is a truly realistic look at the awesome power of a weapon that can destroy the entire United States, literally within one second.</p> <p>In the tradition of <em>On the Beach</em>, <em>Fail Safe</em>, and <em>Testament</em>, this book, set in a typical American town, is a dire warning of what might be our future and our end.</p>";
