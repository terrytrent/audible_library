window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Is there credible proof that Jesus of Nazareth really is the Son of God? In </b><b><i>The Case for Christ</i></b><b>, Lee Strobel, former legal editor of the </b><b><i>Chicago Tribune</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>New York Times </i></b><b>bestselling author, retraces his own spiritual journey from atheism to faith and builds a captivating case for Christ's divinity.</b></p> <p>In this revised and updated edition of <i>The Case for Christ</i>, Strobel cross-examines a dozen experts with doctorates from schools such as Cambridge, Princeton, and Brandeis, asking hard-hitting questions—and taking a deeper look at the evidence from the fields of science, philosophy, and history.</p> <p>In his comprehensive investigation, Strobel doesn't shy away from challenging questions, including:</p> <ul> <li>How reliable is the New Testament?</li> <li>Does evidence for Jesus exist outside the Bible?</li> <li>Is Jesus who he said he was?</li> <li>Is there any reason to believe the resurrection was an actual event?</li> <li>What does all of the evidence point to--and what does it mean today?</li> </ul> <p>Winner of the Gold Medallion Book Award and twice nominated for the Christian Book of the Year Award, <i>The Case for Christ </i>has been adapted into a major motion picture and has now sold over 5 million copies worldwide.</p> <p>This edition includes scores of revisions and additions, including updated material on archaeological and manuscript discoveries, fresh recommendations for further study, and an interview with the author that tells dramatic stories about the book's impact, provides behind-the-scenes information, and responds to critiques of the book by skeptics.</p> <p>Strobel's thorough examination reads like a captivating, fast-paced novel. But it's not fiction: it's a riveting quest for the truth about history's most compelling figure. Discover <i>The Case for Christ </i>today.</p> <p><b>Praise for </b><b><i>The Case for Christ</i></b><b>:</b></p> <p>\"Nobody knows how to sift truth from fiction like an experienced investigative reporter, or to argue a case like someone trained at Yale Law School. Lee Strobel brings both qualifications to this remarkable book. In addition to his own tremendous testimony as atheist-turned-Christian, the author marshals the irrefutable depositions of recognized \"expert witnesses\" to build his ironclad case for Jesus Christ. <i>The Case for Christ</i> sets a new standard among existing contemporary apologetics.\"</p> <p><b>--D.
