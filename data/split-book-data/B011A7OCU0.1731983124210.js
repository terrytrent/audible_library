window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>An all-new digital single - part of the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling series based on the blockbuster Xbox games! </p> <p>The military-grade artificial intelligence known as Iona has only one week to live. After that the UNSC will legally terminate her seven-year existence in order to stave off the threat of the data corruption phenomenon known as \"rampancy\", a condition that will eventually take hold of her functionality and persona, endangering all those around her. In a last-ditch effort to save herself, Iona has successfully launched an unprecedented legal appeal against her own death sentence - a case being watched very closely not only at the highest levels of human government but by others with a very <i>different</i> agenda.... </p>";
