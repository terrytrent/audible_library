window.bookSummaryJSON = "On October 4, 1957, a time of Cold War paranoia, the Soviet Union secretly launched the Earth's first artificial moon. No bigger than a basketball, the tiny satellite was powered by a car battery. Yet, for all its simplicity, <i>Sputnik</i> stunned the world. <p>Based on extensive research in the US and newly opened archives in the former USSR, <i>Red Moon Rising</i> tells the story of five extraordinary months in the history of technology and the rivalry between two superpowers. It takes us inside the Kremlin and introduces the Soviet engineer Korolev, the charismatic, politically-minded visionary who motivated Khruschev to support what others dismissed as a ridiculous program. Korolev is virtually unknown to most Americans, yet it is because of him that NASA exists, that college loan programs were started in the U.S., and that Kennedy and Johnson became presidents.</p> <p> Character driven, suspenseful, and dramatic, <i>Red Moon Rising</i> unveils the politics, people, science, and mindset behind a critical and transformative world event.</p>";
