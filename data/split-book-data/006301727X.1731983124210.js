window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>\"Chickie takes us thousands of miles on a hilarious quest laced with sorrow, but never dull. You will laugh and cry, but you will not be sorry that you read this rollicking story.\" (Malachy McCourt)</b></p> <p>Soon to be a major motion picture written and directed by Peter Farrelly, who won two Academy Awards for <i>Green Book</i> - a wildly entertaining, feel-good memoir of an Irish American New Yorker and former US marine who embarked on a courageous, harebrained scheme to deliver beer to his pals serving Vietnam in the late 1960s.</p> <p>One night in 1967, 26-year-old John Donohue - known as Chick - was out with friends, drinking in a New York City bar. The friends gathered there had lost loved ones in Vietnam. Now, they watched as anti-war protesters turned on the troops themselves. One neighborhood patriot came up with an inspired - some would call it insane - idea. Someone should sneak into Vietnam, track down their buddies there, give them messages of support from back home, and share a few laughs over a can of beer. It would be the Greatest Beer Run Ever. But who'd be crazy enough to do it? One man was up for the challenge - a US Marine Corps veteran turned merchant mariner who wasn't about to desert his buddies on the front lines when they needed him. Chick volunteered. A day later, he was on a cargo ship headed to Vietnam, armed with Irish luck and a backpack full of alcohol. </p> <p>Landing in Qui Nho'n, Chick set off on an adventure that would change his life forever - an odyssey that took him through a series of hilarious escapades and harrowing close calls, including the Tet Offensive. But none of that mattered if he could bring some cheer to his pals and show them how much the folks back home appreciated them.This is the story of that epic beer run, told in Chick's own words and those of the men he visited in Vietnam.</p> <p>Supplemental enhancement PDF accompanies the audiobook. </p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b> </p>";
