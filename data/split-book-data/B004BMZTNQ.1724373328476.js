window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>This story is for everyone - but not everyone is for this story. </p> <p>This is a dangerous tale of times past... a love story full of deep seduction. A story of terrible longing and bold sacrifice. </p> <p>Then as now, evil begins its courtship cloaked in light. And the heart embraces what it should flee, forgetting it once had a truer lover. </p> <p>With a kiss, evil will ravage body, soul, and mind. Yet there remains hope, because the heart knows no bounds. Love will prove greater than lust. Sacrifice will overcome seduction. And blood will flow. Because the battle for the heart is always violently opposed. </p> <p>For those desperate to drink deep from this fountain of life, enter. But remember, not everyone is for this story.</p>";
