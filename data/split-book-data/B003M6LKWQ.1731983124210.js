But now, in defiance of their Black King, the warrior-prince Rugar and his fearless daughter, Jewel, have marshaled an invasion farce to meet its ultimate challenge: Blue Isle, glistening beyond impregnable rocks and raging waters.</p><p>A people of simplicity and faith, untainted by intrigue, enchantment, or war, the Blue Islanders have never before been invaded.

So begins a conflict that must ultimately destroy one race or the other - or both.</p>";
