window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Travel to the future - it will cost you only everyone you love. </p> <p>Attacked and injected with a drug that slows his metabolism to a fraction of normal, Martin James becomes an unwilling time traveler who hurtles through the years. His children grow up, his wife grows older, and his only hope is finding the people who injected him in the first place - not an easy task when one day for Martin lasts four years. And while Martin James strives to find a cure before everyone he loves is gone, others are uncertain if his journey can be stopped at all. </p> <p>W. Lawrence weaves a dystopian future filled with the best and worst of humanity, highlights the blessings and curses of technology, and pushes the limits of faith and hopelessness. Above all, <i>Syncing Forward</i> is a tale of one man's love for his family and their devotion to saving him from being lost forever. </p>";
