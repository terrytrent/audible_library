Now Admiral John “Black Jack” Geary embarks on a thrilling new adventure to defend the Alliance and safeguard the future.</p> <p>Geary and the crew of the Dauntless have managed to safely escort important alien representatives to Earth. But before they can make tracks for home, two of Geary’s key lieutenants vanish.

Geary is ordered to take a small force to the border of Syndic space. But what he finds there is a danger much greater than anyone expected: A mysterious threat that could finally force the Alliance to its knees.</p> <p>As Geary spearheads a desperate battle to protect the Alliance against a shrewd and powerful enemy, he’s left with just one question: Who are they?</p>";
