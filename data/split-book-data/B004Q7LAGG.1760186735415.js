window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The second novel set in the Old Republic era and based on the massively multiplayer online game <i>Star Wars: The Old Republic</i> ramps up the action and brings listeners \"face-to-face\" for the first time with a Sith warrior to rival the most sinister of the Order’s Dark Lords: Darth Malgus, the mysterious, masked Sith of the wildly popular “Deceived” and “Hope” game trailers. </p> <p>Malgus brought down the Jedi Temple on Coruscant in a brutal assault that shocked the galaxy. But if war crowned him the darkest of Sith heroes, peace would transform him into something far more heinous - something Malgus would never want to be, but cannot stop, any more than he can stop the rogue Jedi fast approaching. </p> <p>Her name is Aryn Leneer - and the lone Knight that Malgus cut down in the fierce battle for the Jedi Temple was her Master. And now she’s going to find out what happened to him - even if it means breaking every rule in the book. </p>";
