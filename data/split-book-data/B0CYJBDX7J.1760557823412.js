Joe has cancer, his doctor tells him, with maybe six months to live.</p> <p>Joe decides to take fate into his own hands. Accessing the underground network of fellow hit men, he puts out a contract on himself: six million dollars from a Swiss bank account to the professional who will end his suffering quickly. The money and bragging rights for putting away one of the world’s most accomplished assassins draws his colleagues from around the world. The killer’s game is on.</p> <p>But then Joe gets a follow-up from his doctors. He was misdiagnosed. It’s not cancer; he should have many years to live. Except that now there’s no way to call off the hit.</p> <p>Armed with only a few dollars and a credit card, Joe is on the run from a formidable lineup of talented killers. Will the Slugger have what it takes to outrun the competition?</p> <p><b>“Serious entertainment, a high-octane romp with a suitably cataclysmic climax and a deliciously exotic cast of international assassins.”—</b><b><i>The Times</i></b><b> (London)</b></p>";
