window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The past Janeal thought had burned away is rising from the ashes.</p> <p>Years ago, the Gypsy Kumpania where Janeal Mikkado lived was attacked by outsiders. With her best friend about to be consumed by a fire, Janeal had two options: try to save her friend—at serious risk to her own life—or disappear with the million dollars that she had just discovered.</p> <p>But the past is quickly coming back to haunt her. Both the best friend and the boyfriend that she was sure were dead have reappeared in her life, as has someone who knows about the money. There's a debt to be paid for the money she found, but there's an even greater debt she must face—and if the chaff isn't burned from her own heart, it will consume her.</p>";
