window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Scions have no limits. Scions do not die. And Scions do not disappear.</p> <p>Sergeant Ted Regan has a problem. A son of one of the great corporate families, a Scion, has gone missing at the front. He should have been protected by his Ironclad - the lethal battle suits that make the Scions masters of war - but something has gone catastrophically wrong.</p> <p>Now Regan and his men, ill-equipped and demoralised, must go behind enemy lines, find the missing Scion and uncover how his suit failed. Is there a new Ironclad killer out there? And how are common soldiers, lacking the protection afforded the rich, supposed to survive the battlefield of tomorrow?</p> <p>A stand-alone audiobook by the Arthur C Clarke Award-winning author of <i>Children of Time</i>.</p>";
