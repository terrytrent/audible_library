window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>New York Times</i> best-selling author David Wong's <i>Zoey Punches the Future in the Dick</i> is the latest - and arguably greatest - sci-fi thriller in the Zoey Ashe series.</p> <p>In the futuristic city of Tabula Ra$a, Zoey Ashe is like a fish so far out of water that it has achieved orbit. After inheriting a criminal empire, the 23-year-old finds herself under threat from all sides as a rogue's gallery of larger-than-life enemies think they smell weakness.</p> <p>On the eve of the world's most lavish and ridiculous Halloween celebration, a steamer trunk-sized box arrives at Zoey's door, and she is shocked to find that it contains a disemboweled corpse. She is even more shocked when that corpse, controlled by an unknown party, rises and goes on a rampage through the house. Speaking in an electronic voice, it publicly accuses Zoey of being its murderer. This is the kind of thing that almost never happened at her old job.</p> <p>The city was already a ticking time bomb of publicity-hungry vigilantes with superhuman enhancements, and Zoey knows this turn of events is unlikely to improve the situation. Now, she and her team of high-tech tricksters have to solve this bizarre murder while simultaneously keeping Tabula Ra$a from descending into chaos.</p> <p>“Biting humor and blatant digs at modern society overlay a subtly brilliant and thoughtful plot” (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>) in <i>John Dies at the End</i> author David Wong’s first installment of the Zoey Ashe series, <i>Futuristic Violence and Fancy Suits</i>. Now, “one of today’s great satirists” (<i>Nerdist</i>) is back with<i> Zoey Punches the Future in the Dick</i>, the second installment in a “Technicolor tomorrowland” (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>).</p>";
