They have a plot to raid the treasure hoard of Smaug the Magnificent, a large and very dangerous dragon… </p> <p>The prelude to <i>The Lord of The Rings</i>,<i> the Hobbit</i> has sold many millions of copies since its publication in 1937, establishing itself as one of the most influential books of the 20th century.</p>";
