window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Featuring a new preface, afterword, and Radically Candid performance-review bonus chapter, the fully revised and updated edition of </b><b><i>Radical Candor</i></b><b> is packed with even more guidance to help you improve your relationships at work. </b></p> <p><b>Radical Candor </b><b><i>has been embraced around the world by leaders of every stripe at companies of all sizes. Now a cultural touchstone, the concept has come to be applied to a wide range of human relationships.</i></b></p> <p><b><i>The idea is simple</i></b><b>: </b>You don't have to choose between being a pushover and a jerk. Using Radical Candor - avoiding the perils of Obnoxious Aggression, Manipulative Insincerity, and Ruinous Empathy - you can be kind and clear at the same time.</p> <p>Kim Scott was a highly successful leader at Google before decamping to Apple, where she developed and taught a management class. Since the original publication of <i>Radical Candor</i> in 2017, Scott has earned international fame with her vital approach to effective leadership and co-founded the Radical Candor executive education company, which helps companies put the book's philosophy into practice.</p> <p><i>Radical Candor</i> is about caring personally and challenging directly, about soliciting criticism to improve your leadership and also providing guidance that helps others grow. It focuses on praise but doesn't shy away from criticism - to help you love your work <i>and</i> the people you work with. </p> <p>Radically Candid relationships with team members enable bosses to fulfill their three core responsibilities:</p> <p></p> <ol> <li>Create a culture of Compassionate Candor.</li> <li>Build a cohesive team.</li> <li>Achieve results collaboratively. </li> </ol> <p>Required listening for the most successful organizations, <i>Radical Candor </i>has raised the bar for management practices worldwide.</p>";
