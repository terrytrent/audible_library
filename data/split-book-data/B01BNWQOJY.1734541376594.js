window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"Madcap lunacy!\" </p> <p>Steve and Orson are back in this cracked sequel to <i>Hell's Super</i>, book two in the new satire and humor series, Circles in Hell. This time, the guys must fix Hell's heating and air conditioning (HVAC) system, which has failed. Hell is getting progressively colder, and things are a lot more serious than devils and demons needing to put on some sweaters. </p> <p>If you've ever used the expression, \"It will be a cold day in Hell before...\", then you know that there are metaphysical ramifications involved. The HVAC system must be fixed before all Hell freezes over, which is an even worse state than just a bit of frigid weather. Still, anything can happen on a cold day in Hell...even a paranormal comedy romance that becomes a whacky love triangle. </p> <p><i>A Cold Day in Hell</i> is the second volume in the fantasy comedy series, Circles in Hell. It has been compared to other works of paranormal humor and Hell fiction including <i>The Screwtape Letters</i> and <i>Good Omens</i> and to the writings of Tom Holt, Christopher Moore, and Douglas Adams. </p>";
