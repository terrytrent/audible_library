window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>The End of Faith</i>. <i>The God Delusion</i>. <i>God Is Not Great</i>. <i>Letter to a Christian Nation</i>. Best seller lists are filled with doubters. But what happens when you actually doubt your doubts?</p> <p>Timothy Keller, the founding pastor of Redeemer Presbyterian Church in New York City, addresses the frequent doubts that skeptics, and even ardent believers, have about religion. Using literature, philosophy, real-life conversations, and potent reasoning, Keller explains how the belief in a Christian God is, in fact, a sound and rational one. To true believers he offers a solid platform on which to stand their ground against the backlash to religion created by the Age of Skepticism. And to skeptics, atheists, and agnostics, he provides a challenging argument for pursuing the reason for God.</p>";
