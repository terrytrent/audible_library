window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>“Everything is relative, especially where Einstein is concerned!”</p> <p>Steve Minion, Heaven’s Emissary to Hell, reunites with his pal Orson Welles to catch a supernatural thief in this comedic “catch me if you can” tale. Go with them on a wild ride through the Circles of Hell, outer space, inner space, even the lower dimensions. Can the guys measure up? For that matter, can they measure anything, when nothing seems constant except their friendship? </p> <p>The action is nonstop. Wrestling, rodeo tricks, hurtling through the sky, even hiking through perhaps the creepiest valley ever known. </p> <p><i>A Room of Steve’s Own, or Give Us Some Space!</i> is the ninth volume in the satire/fantasy comedy series Circles in Hell. It has been compared to other works of “Hell Fiction” including <i>The Screwtape Letters</i> and <i>Good Omens</i> and to the paranormal humor of Tom Holt, Christopher Moore, Gary Larson, and Douglas Adams. </p> <p><i>Comedy fiction book categories:</i></p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Satire and humor </li> <li>Fantasy comedy books </li> <li>Science-fiction comedy </li> <li>Hell fiction </li> <li>Humorous fantasy books </li> <li>Devils and demons </li> <li>Humorous fiction</li> <li>Paranormal humor</li> </ul>";
