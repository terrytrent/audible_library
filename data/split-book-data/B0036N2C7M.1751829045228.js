window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>A Fire Upon the Deep</i> is the big, breakout book that fulfills the promise of Vinge's career to date: a gripping tale of galactic war told on a cosmic scale. Thousands of years hence, many races inhabit a universe where a mind's potential is determined by its location in space, from superintelligent entities in the Transcend, to the limited minds of the Unthinking Depths, where only simple creatures and technology can function. </p> <p>Nobody knows what strange force partitioned space into these \"regions of thought\", but when the warring Straumli realm use an ancient Transcendent artifact as a weapon, they unwittingly unleash an awesome power that destroys thousands of worlds and enslaves all natural and artificial intelligence.</p> <p>Fleeing the threat, a family of scientists, including two children, are taken captive by the Tines, an alien race with a harsh medieval culture, and used as pawns in a ruthless power struggle. A rescue mission, not entirely composed of humans, must rescue the children-and a secret that may save the rest of interstellar civilization.</p> <p><i>A Fire upon the Deep</i>, which began the Zones of Thought series, is the winner of the 1993 Hugo Award for Best Novel. </p>";
