Even the forces of nature respond to their words. And their mission crosses lines between warring factions, as well as between competing spiritual principalities. In the process, they have provoked as many death-threats as they have healed bodies and souls.<br> <br> While the threats multiply alongside the temptations to be venerated, they remain true to the One who has sent them and the One who provides the power and the protection. It is His power. And all to His Glory.<br> <br> They have attracted new teammates who bring their own extraordinary gifts, the sort of gifts required to see into the realm in which the real battle rages. Together they demonstrate the power of the Kingdom in a way that combines the force of the Old Testament prophets, the New Testament disciples and Jesus, Himself.<br> <br> This is the second book in <b>The Two Witnesses</b> series. Be sure to listen to the first book to see how this cosmic conflict began.</p>";
