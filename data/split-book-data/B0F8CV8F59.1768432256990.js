Out of that belief come miraculous signs and stunning wonders.<br> <br> How can such power be wielded by two ordinary people? The answer is clear—two answers, opposing responses. These two people are either servants of demons or they are coworkers with angels.<br> <br> Elijah Kimani and Miram Law have saturated themselves in the Spirit of Jesus. This is the same Jesus who raised the dead, walked on water, and calmed a storm. The two witnesses are dedicated to the revelation that this Jesus is alive and well on Planet Earth. And that he has remedies for a terrifying age.<br> <br> Their mission will undermine the principalities and powers all over the world and will inspire religious and political organizations to oppose them. Even plot to kill them.<br> <br> But, then, that was what the authorities did to Jesus of Nazareth.</p>";
