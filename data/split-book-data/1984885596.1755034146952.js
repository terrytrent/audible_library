Guido Rahr’s mission to save the wild Pacific salmon leads him into adventures that make for a breathtakingly exciting read.\" (Ian Frazier, author of </b><b><i>Travels in Siberia</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p><b>Editors’ Choice: </b><b><i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b><b> • </b><b><i>Outside Magazine</i></b><b> • </b><b><i>National Book Review</i></b><b> • </b><b><i>Forbes</i></b></p> <p>In the tradition of <i>Mountains Beyond Mountains</i> and <i>The Orchid Thief</i>, <i>Stronghold</i> is Tucker Malarkey’s eye-opening account of one of the world’s greatest fly fishermen and his crusade to protect the world’s last bastion of wild salmon.</p> <p>From a young age, Guido Rahr was a misfit among his family and classmates, preferring to spend his time in the natural world. When the salmon runs of the Pacific Northwest began to decline, Guido was one of the few who understood why. As dams, industry, and climate change degraded the homes of these magnificent fish, Rahr saw that the salmon of the Pacific Rim were destined to go the way of their Atlantic brethren: near extinction. An improbable and inspiring story, <i>Stronghold</i> takes us on a wild adventure, from Oregon to Alaska to one of the world’s last remaining salmon strongholds in the Russian Far East, a landscape of ecological richness and diversity that is rapidly being developed for oil, gas, minerals, and timber. Along the way, Rahr contends with scientists, conservationists, Russian oligarchs, corrupt officials, and unexpected allies in an attempt to secure a stronghold for the endangered salmon, an extraordinary keystone species whose demise would reverberate across the planet.</p> <p>Tucker Malarkey, who joins Rahr in the Russian wilderness, has written a clarion call for a sustainable future, a remarkable work of natural history, and a riveting account of a species whose future is closely linked to our own.</p> <p><b>Praise for </b><b><i>Stronghold</i></b></p> <p>\"This book isn’t just about fish, it’s about life itself and the fragile unseen threads that connect all creatures across this beleaguered orb we call home. Guido Rahr’s quest to save the world’s wild salmon should serve as an inspiration - and a provocation - for us all, and Tucker Malarkey’s exquisite book captures Rahr’s weird and wonderful story with poignancy, humor, and grace.\" (Hampton Sides, author of <i>In the Kingdom of Ice </i>and<i> Blood and Thunder</i>)</p> <p>\"A crazy-good, intensely lived book that reads like an international thriller - only it’s our beloved salmon playing the part of diamonds or oil or gold.\" (David James Duncan, author of <i>The River Why</i> and <i>The Brothers K</i>)</p>";
