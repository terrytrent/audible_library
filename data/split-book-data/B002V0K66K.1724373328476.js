Why did sales of jam multiply tenfold when consumers were offered many fewer flavors? Why did people prefer a Mercedes immediately after giving reasons why they prefer a BMW? What simple message on cards left in hotel rooms greatly increased the number of people who behaved in environmentally friendly ways?</p> <p>Often counterintuitive, the findings presented in <i>Yes!</i> will steer you away from common pitfalls while empowering you with little known but proven wisdom.</p> <p>Whether you are in advertising, marketing, management, on sales, or just curious about how to be more influential in everyday life, <i>Yes!</i> shows how making small, scientifically proven changes to your approach can have a dramatic effect on your persuasive powers.</p>";
