After decades of model-trained AIs wreaking havoc across the globe, humanity is ready to try something a little more…human.</p> <p>Henry is perfect. For one thing, as a reconstituted intelligence, he has no rights and can be forced to do the bidding of the powers that be.

Our hopes and dreams go with you. Oh, and while you’re at it, could you take a look at the aliens setting up shop in our asteroid belt? They seem to be…multiplying.</b></p> <p><i>Download </i>I, Starship<i> now and grab the edge of your seat for this bold new space opera.</i></p>";
