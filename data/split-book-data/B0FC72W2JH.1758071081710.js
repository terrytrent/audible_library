window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The galaxy just called for help. Unfortunately, the wrong man answered.</p> <p>When small-time conman, Cal Carver, is thrown in jail and forced to share a cell with a semi-naked cannibalistic serial killer, he's pretty sure his day can't get any worse.</p> <p>Boy, is he wrong.</p> <p>It isn't until two-thirds of the human race is wiped out and Cal is mistakenly abducted by aliens that things really start to go downhill.</p> <p>Whisked across the galaxy, Cal is forced into a team of some of the sector's most notorious villains and scumbags and tasked with delivering a package to a warlord-run solar system where the authorities daren't venture.</p> <p>The mission should be simple enough, but as one screw-up leads to another the ragtag group of unwitting heroes find themselves in a frantic battle to save an entire alien civilization—and its god—from total annihilation.</p> <p>Featuring epic space battles, hilariously snarky characters, and a shapeshifting blob with the face of Tobey Maguire, <i>Space Team</i> is the first book in the internationally best-selling series by award-winning author, Barry J. Hutchison.</p> <p>Perfect for fans of <i>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Galaxy Quest, Guardians of the Galaxy</i>, and pretty much anything else with the word \"Galaxy\" in the title.</p> <p>**Except Samsung's Galaxy S series, which is a range of mobile devices, and so not really similar.</p> <p>You don't really want to stick around on Earth, do you? Have you seen the state of the place? Join Space Team now, and blast off on an action-packed adventure that'll have you laughing your puny human head off.(Not literally. I hope).</p>";
