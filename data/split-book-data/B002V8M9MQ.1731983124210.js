window.bookSummaryJSON = "It's the 21st century, and let's be honest: things are a little disappointing. Despite every World's Fair prediction and the advertisements in comic books, we are not living the future we were promised. By now, life was supposed to be a fully automated, atomic-powered, germ-free Utopia, a place where a grown man could wear a velvet spandex unitard and not be laughed at. Where are the ray guns, the flying cars, and the hoverboards that we expected? What happened to our moon colonies and servant robots? <p> In <i>Where's My Jetpack?</i> roboticist Daniel H. Wilson takes a hilarious look at the future we imagined for ourselves. You will learn which technologies are already available - and if the technology is not public, you will learn how to build, buy, or steal it. <i>Where's My Jetpack?</i> is an entertaining look at the world that we always wanted.</p>";
