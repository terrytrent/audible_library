window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Cameron Winter is troubled in heart and mind. He's plagued by memories of his time as a government operative investigating a notorious Turkish sex trafficker. The fact that the mission was left unfinished still haunts him and threatens to tear him apart. In the midst of his painful soul-searching, Winter crosses paths with an ex-flame—his first love—and the chance encounter ignites a passion he thought was long lost. But just as soon as she wanders back into Winter's life, the woman vanishes, leaving Winter scrambling to track her down.</p> <p>His pursuit takes him deep into a world rent by partisan violence, where extremists clash and Winter sides with no one. As he faces his most dangerous case yet, victory might simply mean getting out alive.</p> <p>Like previous entries featuring this \"complex and determined\" series character (BookReporter), A Woman Underground harnesses multiple Edgar Award-winning author Andrew Klavan's crime writing expertise to explore some of the biggest issues facing us today. The result is a poignant must-listen with an intricate plot, shot through with high-stakes action and unflinching humanity.</p>";
