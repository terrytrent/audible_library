Captain Jace Hughes and his crew have finally reached their destination: Earth, the mythical lost homeworld of humanity. It was said to harbor great wonders, fertile land, and beauty beyond comparison, but the reality is far, far stranger than any story. The Earth isn’t what they thought, and it must be rebuilt.</p> <p>Using the newly acquired <i>Galactic Dawn</i> as a refitted transport vessel, Jace hopes to bring help from displaced worlds whose inhabitants can no longer sustain themselves. He’s going to need all the help he can get to jumpstart this new colony. That means farmers, workers, soldiers, and, perhaps most importantly, families, all of them working together to build a home they can call their own. But the Earth harbors many dangerous secrets, each one more deadly than the last. Secrets that could mean the end of everything Jace and his friends have worked so hard to achieve. The time for exploration and discovery has begun. Try not to get yourself killed.</p> <p><i>Renegade Children</i>, book eight</p> <p>People are dying. Shortly after Captain Jace Hughes and his team recover hundreds of surviving Eternal refugees, disaster strikes. A recently unearthed fauna dome, one of many biological arks on Earth, is destroyed and several people are killed. All proof points to the Eternals.</p> <p>Meanwhile, shortly after the slip tunnel at the center of the planet is shut down for good, a strange distress signal is detected. It appears to be coming from somewhere on the planet, but the exact coordinates are unknown. Two investigations are launched. One for the saboteur; the other for the source of the signal. With rising tensions between the colonists and the Eternals, Jace must do everything he can to prevent a bloody confrontation.</p>";
