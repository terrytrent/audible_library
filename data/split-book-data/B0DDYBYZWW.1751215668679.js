window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>For fans of Octavia E Butler, Margaret Atwood and Naomi Alderman, a thrilling, heart-wrenching debut novel from Karla Marie Sweet, exploring disparity of privilege, the quest for identity and the human need for connection.</p> <p>When the External Womb Programme is launched, the news is controversial. Hundreds take to the streets in protest, feeling strongly that growing a baby outside of the human body is \"unnatural\". But thousands more people rejoice: at last, an alternative for those who wish to have children but worry about the physical toll it may take. A chance that throwing a baby-shaped grenade into one's career path might not derail it entirely.</p> <p>For Lucy, whose acting career is finally taking off, the news is well worth celebrating. Could having a baby this way mean she can have it all? As she and her husband James embark on their journey, however, it becomes clear she's not being entirely honest with him and, as an old flame returns, everything is thrown into jeopardy.</p> <p>Decades later, the use of external wombs is commonplace. But a corrupt government stepping into power leads to this groundbreaking piece of technology falling into the wrong hands, forcing everyone to reckon with a challenging new world and their place within it.</p> <p>Performed by Erin Doherty (<i>The Crown</i>) and Kingsley Ben-Adir (<i>Bob Marley: One Love</i>), <i>Another Life</i> marks the arrival of a brilliant new literary talent that will thrill, entertain and challenge you from beginning to end.</p>";
