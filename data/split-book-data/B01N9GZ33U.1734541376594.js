window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The men of the 77th Infantry Division couldn't fathom why Private Desmond T. Doss would venture into the horrors of World War II without a single weapon to defend himself. </p> <p>\"You're nothing but a coward!\" they said. But the soft-spoken medic insisted that his mission was to heal, not kill. </p> <p>When Desmond knelt by his bunk to pray, his fellow soldiers hurled boots and insults at him. Even his commander wanted to throw him out of the army. But when his unit arrived on the battlefield, the intrepid medic quickly proved he was no coward. </p> <p>One terrifying day in the vicious battle for Okinawa, dozens of Desmond's former tormenters lay wounded and bleeding atop Hacksaw Ridge. As Japanese bullets rained down, their fate seemed hopeless. </p> <p>Could one unarmed man save their lives? </p> <p>This pause-resister will keep you riveted to your seat as you discover how Desmond Doss became the first conscientious objector to receive the Medal of Honor. Desmond's dramatic true story of integrity, redemption, and heroism will inspire you to live by the courage of your convictions. </p>";
