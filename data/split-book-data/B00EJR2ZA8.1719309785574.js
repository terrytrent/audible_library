window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A thrilling spin-off from Jack Campbell’s The Lost Fleet series, <i>The Lost Stars: Tarnished Knight</i> delivered \"excellent tales of space battles and struggles against tyrants and aliens\". Now the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author returns with the next chapter in the overthrow of the Syndicate Worlds’ oppression…. </p> <p>Following a successful coup, the leaders of the rebel Midway Star System struggle to forge a government free enough to please its citizens yet strong enough to secure power. But in a world where former rulers have become new foes, an alien threat to humanity may turn old adversaries into uncertain allies. </p> <p>General Artur Drakon knows three words describe someone who confides in a Syndicate CEO: Stupid. Betrayed. Dead. Despite his misgivings, he partnered with another former CEO to overthrow Syndic forces. Now, with an enigma fleet menacing their hard-earned independence, he can ill afford to trust her - or lose her support. </p> <p>President Gwen Iceni believes Midway is humanity’s defense against the enigmas. Syndicate training taught her self-preservation in a crisis, yet she’s determined to fight for the star system’s fate…even if it means joining forces with Drakon - and an officer of the hated Alliance. </p> <p>Their plan places the Midway flotilla at great risk in hopes of greater reward: recruiting the personnel necessary to man warships against the enigmas. But before facing the alien advance, Drakon and Iceni must survive hidden dangers closer to home: all-too-human threats that could jeopardize Midway’s freedom…and their own lives.</p>";
