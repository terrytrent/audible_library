window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Discover the astonishing evidence for intelligent design in this </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling book by award-winning journalist Lee Strobel.</b></p> <p>\"My road to atheism was paved by science...but, ironically, so was my later journey to God,\" Strobel says.</p> <p>During his academic years, Lee Strobel became convinced that God was obsolete, a belief that colored his journalism career. Science had made the idea of a creator irrelevant - or so Strobel thought.</p> <p>But today science points in a different direction. A diverse and impressive body of research has increasingly supported the conclusion that the universe was intelligently designed. At the same time, Darwinism has faltered in the face of concrete facts and hard reason. Has science discovered God? At the very least, it's giving faith an immense boost, as new findings emerge about the incredible complexity of our universe.</p> <p>Join Strobel as he reexamines the theories that once led him away from God. Through his compelling and highly readable account, you'll encounter the mind-stretching discoveries from cosmology, cellular biology, DNA research, astronomy, physics, and human consciousness that present compelling evidence in <i>The Case for a Creator</i>.</p> <p>Also available: <i>The Case for a Creator </i>small group video study and study guide, Spanish edition, kids' edition, student edition, and more.</p> <p>Suggested reading, study guide, and end notes are available in the audiobook companion PDF download. </p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b> </p>";
