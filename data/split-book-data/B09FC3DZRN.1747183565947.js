window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Adam Cain has pursued his nemesis Nigel McCarthy to the Milky Way's sister galaxy - The Large Magellanic Cloud - using the revolutionary technology of the concentrated-array gravity-drive. This is virgin territory for the Humans - an entire galaxy that knows nothing of the special abilities of the people from Earth.</p> <p>Adam's troubles begin with his very first planetfall in this new galaxy, when a coalition of aliens band together to steal Adam's starship - The Pegasus - so they can learn the secrets of his exotic gravity drive. Without his ship, Adam can't complete his mission - that of eliminating the evil Nigel McCarthy once and for all.</p> <p>Yet Adam's mission is further complicated when another one of his old enemies shows up - the former leader of the Expansion Kroekus of Silea. The alien has come to The Cloud to fulfill his desire for power and control in a galaxy that's defenseless against the forces from the Milky Way. It's a study in political intrigue, tactics and strategies, and how an entire galaxy can be thrust into war by a few individuals with universal-size ambitions.</p>";
