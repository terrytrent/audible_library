window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From Hugo, Nebula and World Fantasy Award winner Joe Haldeman, the best-selling author of <i>The Forever War</i> and <i>Forever Peace</i>, comes a thrilling sci-fi story that examines a world where time truly is money, and what happens when they both run out. </p> <p>More even than space travel, the Stileman Process has altered 21st-century life. The most complex of medical miracles, it ensures that every 10 years or so, the ailing aging body can be restored to youthful vigour and health. There's a catch, of course: the cost. Every 10 years or so, you have to come up with £1,000,000 minimum to repeat the procedure or die. </p> <p>For Dallas Barr, one of the oldest men on earth, it's that time again. While casting around desperately for his next essential £1,000,000, he meets Maria, a woman from - literally - a previous life, and makes two major discoveries. </p> <p>One: Not all Stileman \"immortals\" were born - or created - the same. </p> <p>Two: Someone is trying to kill them. All of them. </p>";
