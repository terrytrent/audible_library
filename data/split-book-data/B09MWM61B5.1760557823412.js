window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From the irrepressible author of <i>Trout Bum</i> and <i>The View from Rat Lake </i>comes an engaging, humorous, often profound examination of life's greatest mysteries: sex, death, and fly-fishing.</p> <p>John Gierach's quest takes us from his quiet home water (an ordinary, run-of-the-mill trout stream where fly-fishing can be a casual affair) to Utah's famous Green River, and to unknown creeks throughout the Western states and Canada. We're introduced to a lively group of fishing buddies, some local \"experts,\" and even an ex-girlfriend, along the way.</p> <p>Contemplative, evocative, and wry, he shares insights on mayflies and men, fishing and sport, life and love, and the meaning (or meaninglessness) of it all.</p>";
