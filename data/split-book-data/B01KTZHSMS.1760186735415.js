window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>We live in an age of skepticism. Our society places such faith in empirical reason, historical progress, and heartfelt emotion that it's easy to wonder: Why should anyone believe in Christianity? What role can faith and religion play in our modern lives?</b> </p> <p>In this thoughtful and inspiring new book, pastor and <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Timothy Keller invites skeptics to consider that Christianity is more relevant now than ever. As human beings we cannot live without meaning, satisfaction, freedom, identity, justice, and hope. Christianity provides us with unsurpassed resources to meet these needs. </p> <p>Written for both the ardent believer and the skeptic, <i>Making Sense of God</i> shines a light on the profound value and importance of Christianity in our lives. </p>";
