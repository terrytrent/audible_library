window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>On account of the superficial points of agreement between Islam and Christianity, many don't see how tremendously deep the divides between them really are, and fewer still have considered the evidence for each faith. How is jihad different from the Crusades? Can we know the life of Jesus as well as the life of Muhammad? What reason is there to believe in one faith over the other, and what difference can the Gospel really make? </p> <p>In <i>No God but One</i>, <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Nabeel Qureshi takes listeners on a global, historical, yet deeply personal journey to the heart of the world's two largest religions. He explores the claims that each faith makes upon believers' intellects and lives, critically examining the evidence in support of their distinctive beliefs. Fleshed out with stories from the annals of both religions, <i>No God but One</i> unveils the fundamental enduring conflict between Islam and Christianity - directly addressing controversial topics like jihad, the Crusades, Sharia, the Trinity, and more. </p> <p>Listeners of Qureshi's first book, <i>Seeking Allah, Finding Jesus</i>, will appreciate his careful and respectful comparison of Islam and Christianity. Both religions teach that there is <i>No God but One</i>, but who deserves to be worshiped, Allah or Jesus? </p>";
