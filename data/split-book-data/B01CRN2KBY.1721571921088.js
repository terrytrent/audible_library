window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>New York Times</i> best seller</p> <p>Set between the events of <i>Return of the Jedi</i> and <i>The Force Awakens</i>, the never-before-told story that began with <i>Star Wars: Aftermath</i> continues in this thrilling novel, the second book of Chuck Wendig’s best-selling trilogy.</p> <p>It is a dark time for the Empire. </p> <p>The Emperor is dead, and the remnants of his former Empire are in retreat. As the New Republic fights to restore a lasting peace to the galaxy, some dare to imagine new beginnings and new destinies. For Han Solo, that means settling his last outstanding debt, by helping Chewbacca liberate the Wookiee’s homeworld of Kashyyyk. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Norra Wexley and her band of Imperial hunters pursue Grand Admiral Rae Sloane and the Empire’s remaining leadership across the galaxy. Even as more and more officers are brought to justice, Sloane continues to elude the New Republic, and Norra fears Sloane may be searching for a means to save the crumbling Empire from oblivion. But the hunt for Sloane is cut short when Norra receives an urgent request from Princess Leia Organa. The attempt to liberate Kashyyyk has carried Han Solo, Chewbacca, and a band of smugglers into an ambush—resulting in Chewie’s capture and Han’s disappearance. </p> <p>Breaking away from their official mission and racing toward the Millennium Falcon’s last known location, Norra and her crew prepare for any challenge that stands between them and their missing comrades. But they can’t anticipate the true depth of the danger that awaits them—or the ruthlessness of the enemy drawing them into his crosshairs.</p> <p>Praise for <i>Aftermath: Life Debt</i></p> <p>“Star Wars: Aftermath: Life Debt has found its place at the top of all the new canon works. Simply, outstandingly great Star Wars.” (<i>Star Wars Post</i>)</p> <p>“[Chuck] Wendig once again strikes gold, offering a sweeping narrative with plenty of insight into both the state of the galaxy at large and beloved characters both new and old.” (<i>Alternative Nation</i>) </p> <p>“With an intense plot, political intrigue and great characterization, Wendig’s Aftermath: Life Debt is an excellent read.” (<i>Flickering Myth Praise</i> for Chuck Wendig’s <i>Aftermath</i>) </p> <p>“<i>Star Wars: Aftermath</i> [reveals] what happened after the events of 1983’s <i>Return of the Jedi</i>. It turns out, there’s more than just the Empire for the good guys to worry about.” (<i>The Hollywood Reporter</i>)</p> <p>“The Force is strong with <i>Star Wars: Aftermath</i>.” (<i>Alternative Nation</i>)</p> <p>“The Star Wars universe is fresh and new again, and just as rich and mysterious as it always was.” (<i>Den of Geek</i>)</p>";
