window.bookSummaryJSON = "A statue, a coin, an old book - they look as dusty as everything else in the Faulkner Antiquarian Bookstore. But when Sam Falkner slips the coin into the statue, he's swept back to Scotland in A.D. 900 - the age of the Vikings. He must find both the statue and another coin in order to escape. It's the first journey in an adventure that will take him to ancient Egypt, World War I, even Dracula's castle...and a mystery that will end only if Sam can find his father in time - literally.";
