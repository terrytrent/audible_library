window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"If you like Christopher Moore or Tom Holt, read <i>Hell's Super</i>.... Hilarious!\" </p> <p>How can one damned handyman keep all of hell running when everything's always breaking, devils and demons plot against him...and he's terrible at fixing things? </p> <p>Steve is hell's super, its handyman. Being Mr. Fixit to the underworld keeps him and his assistant, Orson Welles (yes, that Orson Welles), pretty busy, since things go on the blink all the time down there. No malfunction has ever created so much inconvenience, though, as the malfunction of hell's escalator, which leads from the pearly gates to the depths of Hades. What's worse: The breakdown appears to be sabotage. </p> <p>Satan calls in Steve to investigate. But Steve is distracted these days. He's in love with Flo, a gorgeous, almost saintly figure who has come to hell by choice to ease the suffering of the damned. What's more, she seems to like him, but romance in hell? That could never be. Still, solving the mystery of the escalator could earn him some points with Satan, maybe even a chance with Flo. Or maybe not. </p> <p><i>Hell's Super</i> is the first volume in the satire/fantasy comedy series Circles in Hell. It has been compared to other works of \"hell fiction\" including <i>The Screwtape Letters</i> and <i>Good Omens</i> and to the paranormal humor of Tom Holt, Christopher Moore, and Douglas Adams. </p>";
