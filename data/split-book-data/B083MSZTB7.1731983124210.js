window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In the summer of 1937, Amelia Earhart is the most famous woman in the world - a record-breaking pilot, a best-selling author, and a modern woman shattering the glass ceiling in the early days of aviation. </p> <p>And then she vanishes. </p> <p>In Tampa, Florida, 15-year-old Lizzie Friedlander spends her afternoons glued to her father’s radio, tapping into the enormity of a world she longs to travel. Lizzie can hardly believe her ears when she picks up a radio signal from a faraway source that sets her heart racing: “Amelia Earhart calling SOS!” </p> <p>As Lizzie copies down the transmissions, it’s clear that the Amelia Earhart is not lost at sea, as the newspapers are dreading, but alive and calling for help. In a race against time, Lizzie must convince the local Coast Guard that the radio transmissions were real and that Earhart's life hangs in the balance. But will anyone believe her? </p> <p>Written for audio by David R. Gillham, the acclaimed, <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of <i>City of Women</i>, and performed by Emily Bauer and Hilary Huber, <i>Alone with the Stars</i> is a breathtaking and illuminating tribute to a woman who risked her life in pursuit of new heights, and the young girl who tried desperately to save her when everything went wrong. Inspired by actual events, <i>Alone with the Stars</i> reveals, in riveting detail, the final moments in the life of a great heroine, whose courage changed the world forever.</p>";
