window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>As foretold by ancient prophets, an apocalypse destroyed Earth during the twenty-first century. But two thousand years later Elyon set upon the earth a new Adam. This time, however, he gave humanity an advantage. What was once unseen became seen. It was good and it was called...<i>Green</i>.</p> <p>But the evil Teeleh bided his time in a Black Forest. Then, when least expected, a twenty-four year old named Thomas Hunter fell asleep in our world and woke up in that future Black Forest. A gateway was opened for Teeleh to ravage the land. Devastated by the ruin, Thomas Hunter and his Circle swore to fight the dark scourge until their dying death.</p> <p>That was then. Now the Circle has lost all hope. And Samuel, Thomas Hunter's cherished son, has turned his back on his father and is aligning dark forces to wage the final war. Thomas is crushed--but determined to rescue the Circle and his son even if he has to cross two worlds to do so.</p>";
