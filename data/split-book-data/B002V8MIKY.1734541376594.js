window.bookSummaryJSON = "Within seconds, normally rational, self-controlled people become frenzied killers. Christened \"Haters\" by the media, the attackers strike without warning, killing all who cross their path. People are afraid to go to work, afraid to leave their homes, afraid that at any moment their friends or family could turn on them. In the face of this mindless terror, Danny McCoyne must secure his family, seek shelter, and watch as the world falls apart. \"Attack first, ask questions later\" becomes the order of the day. <p>Soon to be a major motion picture produced by Guillermo del Toro and directed by J. A. Bayona.</p>";
