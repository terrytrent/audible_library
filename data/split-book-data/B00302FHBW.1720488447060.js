window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>No one wanted another war. </p> <p>Thomas Theisman didn't. Not after risking his life to overthrow the Committee of Public Safety's reign of terror and restore the Republic of Haven's ancient Constitution. </p> <p>Baron High Ridge didn't. The Prime Minister of Manticore was perfectly happy with the war he had. No one was shooting anyone else at the moment, and his government could continue to milk all those \"hostilities only\" tax measures for their own partisan projects.</p> <p>His Imperial Majesty Gustav didn't. Now that the fighting between the Star Kingdom and the Havenites had ended, the Andermani Emperor had his own plans for Silesia. </p> <p>Protector Benjamin didn't. His people had made too deep a commitment to the Manticoran Alliance to risk seeing it all thrown away. </p> <p>And Honor Harrington certainly didn't. The <i>Salamander</i> knew too much about how much war cost. </p> <p>Unfortunately, what they wanted didn't matter.... </p> <p><b>A Note from Author David Weber</b> <br> There's been some confusion—not to say, um, energetic debate, readers and fans being readers and fans—about the correct pronunciation of \"Manticoran.\" The truth, alas, is that a stitch was dropped. An error occurred. A mistake was made… and it wasn't Audible's fault. It was mine. Before Audible recorded the very first Honor Harrington book, narrator Allyson Johnson and I not only corresponded by e-mail but actually spoke to one another by phone. She wanted to make absolutely certain she had the correct pronunciations for names, places, star nations, etc., and I tried to make certain all of her questions were answered. And so they were. Unfortunately, at some point in the process, I replied to one of her e-mails by telling her that \"Man-ti-core-ahn\" was pronounced \"Man-tik-er-ahn.\" Exactly how this happened is more than I can say at this point, except to blushingly disclose that the original e-mail remains intact, confirming to all the world that it was, indeed, my fault. I can ascribe it only to a temporary mental hiccup on my part and crave your forgiveness. If, however, you must blame someone for the mix-up, that someone should be me and not Audible, who have done everything they could to get it right.</p>";
