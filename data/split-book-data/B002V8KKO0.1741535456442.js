window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Anyone looking to let off some steam is bound to find something to love in <i>Cabin Pressure</i>. The combination of snappy repartee and brilliant voice-acting makes this a side-achingly funny experience from start to finish. </p> <p>Stephanie Cole (\"Doc Martin\"), Benedict Cumberbatch and Roger Allam (\"The Thick Of It\") star in the complete first series of the hit sitcom about the pilots of a tiny charter airline for whom no job is too small, but many, many jobs are too difficult. Written by John Finnemore, writer for The News Quiz, and That Mitchell &amp; Webb Sound.</p> <p>Run by the forbidding divorc√©e Carolyn Knapp-Shappey (an unfortunate marriage, namewise, but in Carolyn's opinion, marginally better than Carolyn Shappey-Knapp), her two pilots are the smooth, experienced and almost-certainly-fired-by-a-big-airline-for-all-round naughtiness Douglas, and struggling almost-competent pilot and sweaty man Martin. All-round help is provided by Carolyn's near-idiot son, Arthur....</p>";
