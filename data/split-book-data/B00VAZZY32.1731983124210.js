In this newly updated and expanded edition of the best-selling <i>The Phoenix Project</i>, co-author Gene Kim includes a new afterword and a deeper delve into the Three Ways as described in <i>The DevOps Handbook</i>.</p> <p>Bill, an IT manager at Parts Unlimited, has been tasked with taking on a project critical to the future of the business, code named Phoenix Project. But the project is massively over budget and behind schedule. The CEO demands Bill must fix the mess in 90 days, or else Bill’s entire department will be outsourced.</p> <p>With the help of a prospective board member and his mysterious philosophy of the Three Ways, Bill starts to see that IT work has more in common with manufacturing plant work than he ever imagined.
