In the meantime, the Human Fleet is now ready to take on the forces of the Expansion in massive head-to-head battles among the stars. But not all is as it seems, as the puppet-masters - the Klin - soon learn the Humans - and Adam Cain in particular - are aware of their behind-the-scenes manipulations of the Human-Juirean War. </p> <p>The action - as always - is nonstop, as Adam jumps continually from one frying pan into another fire, until he is finally standing before the Supreme Leader of the Klin himself. </p> <p>This epic saga is full of spectacular space battles, exotic aliens, political intrigue, and heroic deeds, and all are presented in a gritty, realistic form that will make you believe these are real people engaged in real adventure. Let the awe and wonder of interstellar adventure come home to you.</p>";
