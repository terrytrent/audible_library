window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Why do some societies collapse into lawless savagery while others prove resilient and lasting?</b></p> <p>On Zero Day of the first and last cyberwar in human history, the internet went dark, transport and power grids collapsed and cities began to starve, showing just how vulnerable the world could be to a targeted campaign of online sabotage. This final instalment of this prescient epic of civilisation collapse finds the small ragtag band of survivors come together to face a new, but eerily familiar threat - the rise of a fascist militia among the ruins of a failing country.</p> <p>With <i>American Kill Switch</i>, John Birminghamâ€™s End of Days trilogy comes to a high-octane, thrilling conclusion.</p>";
