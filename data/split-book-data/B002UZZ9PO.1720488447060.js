window.bookSummaryJSON = "Hugo and Nebula Award-winning author Robert J. Sawyer writes imaginative SF novels that have earned him an enthusiastic following. Set in the near future, <i>Rollback</i> is \"a novel to be savored by science fiction and mainstream readers alike\" ( <i>Globe and Mail</i>). <p>Thirty-eight years ago, Dr. Sarah Halifax earned worldwide fame by deciphering a radio transmission from an unknown intelligence reaching out from deep space. Now 87, Sarah receives news that, at long last, a new signal has been received, and her services are desperately needed once again.</p> <p>But Sarah needs to stay alive long enough to decode the message. With the aid of corporate backers, she and her husband undertake an incredibly costly medical process called a Rollback, in which decades may be added to their lives - but only if it's successful.</p>";
