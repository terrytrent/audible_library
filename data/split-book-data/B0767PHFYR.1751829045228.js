But honest and open conversations are not taking place between management and Agile delivery teams. </p> <p>In <i>A Seat at the Table,</i> CIO Mark Schwartz explores the role of IT leadership as it is now and opens the door to reveal IT leadership as it should be - an integral part of the value creation engine.
