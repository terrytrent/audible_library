window.bookSummaryJSON = "Harry Turtledove, Ph.D., critically acclaimed novelist and \"Master of Alternative History\", enriches his compelling narratives with authentic period details. In this enthralling epic begun by Sidewise Award-winner <i>How Few Remain</i> and continued in <i>Blood &amp; Iron</i>, the Great Depression devours the Roaring Twenties - leaving the USA and the CSA vulnerable. <p>As the Socialist Party battles Coolidge to retain the presidency in 1924, it seems as if it can do no wrong. The stock market soars, and the USA prospers. Although victors in the War of Secession, the CSA still reels from its loss of the Great War while the Freedom Party promises new vigor and pride. But should these gray-shirted fascists seize power, they may prove dangerous. Sharing world supremacy with Germany and bloated with prosperity, the USA fails to notice ominous events inside the weakened CSA.</p>";
