But without the whales, there will be no more time. Our universe will cease to exist. Now the whales are decidedly huge—as large as an average galaxy. But with the application of sufficient cruelty and technology, they can be killed. Existence, once again, hangs in the balance.</p> <p>As has happened before, when there's an existential crisis afoot, who does the cosmos call upon for help? Yes! Jon Ryan, ex-fighter pilot and astronaut, who now resides in an immortal android host. That man has saved our collective bacon more time than you can count on your fingers and toes combined. And there's a major plus this time out. There'll be not one... not two... but three Jon Ryans on the job. Hey, we're talking an unimaginable evil versus galaxy-sized space-going whales. Three Jon Ryans is probably the minimum number necessary to ensure justice is served.</p> <p>The real issue is whether the three Jon Ryans can save the Whales of Time without killing each other in the process. The original two-billion-year-old Jon is not a big fan of either the new android Jon or the Jon who is still flesh and blood. But if they don't work together and well, not only will Xyándor destroy the whales but he'll eliminate the Ryan boys also. Yeah, he's come to hate Jon Ryans as much as he hates whales. Yikes!</p> <p>Join the adventure. See if the ultimate evil will finally knock that smug grin off one of the Jons's face. But hopefully someone will let the super bad guy know that when Jon Ryan's after you, your chances of success are slim-to-none. Just ask any indomitable force that Jon Ryan has trounced in the past. Never piss off a two-billion year old android. It is bad for your health.</p>";
