window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Rick Riordan, the best-selling author of the Percy Jackson series, pumps up the action and suspense in The Lost Hero, the first book in The Heroes of Olympus series. </p> <p>\"Riordan extends the franchise in a logical direction while maximizing the elements that made the first series so popular: irreverent heroes, plenty of tension-filled moments fighting monsters, and authentic classical mythology mixed in with modern life.\"—Horn Book </p> <p>A New York Times best-seller </p> <p>A spin-off of the blockbuster Percy Jackson and the Olympians series, but stands on its own </p> <p>Combines Roman and Greek mythology </p> <p>Told from the points of view of a diverse cast of demigods </p> <p>Memorable characters, witty dialogue, and non-stop action have made this series popular across the globe </p> <p>Perfect for middle grade listeners but can be enjoyed by older listeners, too </p> <p>Jason has a problem. He doesn't remember anything before waking up on a school bus holding hands with a girl. Apparently she's his girlfriend Piper, his best friend is a kid named Leo, and they're all students in the Wilderness School, a boarding school for \"bad kids.\" What he did to end up here, Jason has no idea—except that everything seems very wrong. </p> <p>Piper has a secret. Her father has been missing for three days, and her vivid nightmares reveal that he's in terrible danger. Now her boyfriend doesn't recognize her, and when a freak storm and strange creatures attack during a school field trip, she, Jason, and Leo are whisked away to someplace called Camp Half-Blood. What is going on? </p> <p>Leo has a way with tools. His new cabin at Camp Half-Blood is filled with them. Seriously, the place beats Wilderness School hands down, with its weapons training, monsters, and fine-looking girls. What's troubling is the curse everyone keeps talking about, and that a camper's gone missing. Weirdest of all, his bunkmates insist they are all—including Leo—related to a god. </p> <p>Fans of demigods, prophecies, and quests will be left breathless—and panting for Book Two.</p>";
