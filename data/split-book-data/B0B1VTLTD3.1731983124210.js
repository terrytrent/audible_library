He’s got an agent who barely remembers his name, his ex-girlfriend has hooked up with a Silicon Valley dude, and the milk in his fridge is so far past its sell-by date it’s historic. The only way Jack can scrape together a bare existence is by delivering food to exactly the types of successful people he wishes he could be.</p> <p>Then, one day, a very strange audiobook shows up on his phone. <i>The Killer Instinct</i> seems to be your basic self-help guide, narrated by a washed-up action star named Hector Bruno, and brimming with cheesy advice for how to get your life together.</p> <p>With so little to lose, Jack starts listening...and listening some more. He starts talking to Hector like he’s his best friend.</p> <p>And then...Hector starts talking back.</p>";
