window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The propulsive, shockingly plausible sequel to </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best seller </b><b><i>Daemon</i></b><b>. </b></p> <p>In one of the most buzzed-about debuts, Daniel Suarez introduced a terrifying vision of a new world order, controlled by the Daemon, an insidious computer program unleashed by a hi-tech wunderkind. <i>Daemon </i>captured the attention of the tech community, became a <i>New York Times</i> and Indie best seller, and left listeners hungry for more. Well, more is here, and it's even more gripping than its predecessor.</p> <p>In the opening chapters of <i>Freedom</i>, the Daemon is firmly in control, using an expanded network of real-world, dispossessed darknet operatives to tear apart civilization and rebuild it anew. Soon civil war breaks out in the American Midwest, in a brutal wave of violence that becomes known as the Corn Rebellion. Former detective Pete Sebeck, now the Daemon's most powerful - though reluctant - operative, must lead a small band of enlightened humans toward a populist movement designed to protect the new world order. But the private armies of global business are preparing to crush the Daemon once and for all.</p> <p>In a world of conflicted loyalties, rapidly diminishing human power, and the possibility that anyone can be a spy, what's at stake is nothing less than human freedom's last hope to survive the technology revolution.</p>";
