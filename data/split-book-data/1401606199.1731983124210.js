And Daniel Clark </b><b><i>knows</i></b><b> the elusive killer he's been stalking.</b></p> <p>He's devoted every waking minute as a profiler to find the serial killer known only as Eve. He's pored over the crime scenes of 16 young women who died mysterious deaths, all in underground basements or caverns. He's delved into the killer's head and puzzled over the twisted religious overtones of the killings.</p> <p>What Daniel can't possibly know is that he will be Eve's next victim.

Nothing - not even desperate, dangerous attempts to reexperience his own death - seems to bring him closer to finding the killer.</p> <p>Then Eve strikes again, much closer to home. And Daniel's obsession explodes into a battle for his life...his sanity...his very soul.</p> <p>Enter a world of death and near death that blurs the lines between fiction and reality in a way that will leave you stunned. </p>";
