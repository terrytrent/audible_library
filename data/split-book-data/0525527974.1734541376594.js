window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The best-selling author of </b><b><i>Daemon </i></b><b>returns with a near-future technological thriller, in which a charismatic billionaire recruits a team of adventurers to launch the first deep space mining operation - a mission that could alter the trajectory of human civilization. </b></p> <p>When itinerant cave diver James Tighe receives an invitation to billionaire Nathan Joyce's private island, he thinks it must be a mistake. But Tighe's unique skill set makes him a prime candidate for Joyce's high-risk venture to mine a near-Earth asteroid - with the goal of kick-starting an entire off-world economy. The potential rewards and personal risks are staggering, but the competition is fierce, and the stakes couldn't be higher. </p> <p>Isolated and pushed beyond their breaking points, Tighe and his fellow 21st-century adventurers - ex-soldiers, former astronauts, BASE jumpers, and mountain climbers - must rely on each other to survive not only the dangers of a multi-year expedition but the harsh realities of business in space. They're determined to transform humanity from an Earth-bound species to a space-faring one - or die trying.</p>";
