For Captain Brad Mendoza, his month has gone from bad to worse, and now all anyone seems interested in is the galaxy-changing secret that’s rattling around in his brain. Whoever breaks Brad can build an empire that will rival anything else in the Fringe!<br> <br> But across the Republic, Jessica Lin survived the attempt to take her life, and she’s hunting the evil men and woman who have kidnapped her captain. Armed only with a damaged ship seized from pirates, she must use her wits and a lot of luck to gather a ragtag crew capable of finding and rescuing Brad from the vile mercenaries that hold him captive.<br> <br> Joining her on her quest are Hayley Uvalde, an enigmatic and fast-talking intelligence expert who changes names as often as hair colors, Quinn Boyd, a special forces washout with an unhealthy love of explosives, and Harris, everyone’s favorite makeup artist turned mercenary. Together, they’ll race against a ticking clock to find Brad before he gives up his secret, dies, or likely both.<br> <br> The fourth and longest installment thus far in the favorite <i>Dumb Luck and Dead Heroes</i> series, <i>The Worst Rescuers in the Republic</i> picks up where <i>The Worst Pirate Hunters in the Fringe</i> left off and takes listeners through a twisting and turning science fiction military adventure with a little humor—and a lot of dumb luck—mixed in. Part hard sci-fi and part space opera. Listen to the series that is delighting fans worldwide!</p>";
