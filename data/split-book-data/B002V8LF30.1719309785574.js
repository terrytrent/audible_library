But perhaps more shocking for Blomkvist: the fingerprints found on the murder weapon belong to Lisbeth Salander. </p> <p>Now, as Blomkvist, alone in his belief in her innocence, plunges into his own investigation of the slayings, Salander is drawn into a murderous hunt in which she is the prey, and which compels her to revisit her dark past in an effort to settle with it once and for all.</p>";
