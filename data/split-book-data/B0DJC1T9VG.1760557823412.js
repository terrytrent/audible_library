The world is at war. Captain Hastings, injured and shaken, is invited to Styles Court to recover. It’s a grand old country house - the family home of his old friend - and a perfect haven. Or so it seems. But in the blistering summer heat, trouble is afoot. Simmering tensions are tearing the family apart, and it all comes to a head in the most horrifying way. Emily Inglethorp, the wealthy matriarch of the family, is brutally murdered in the middle of the night. And nobody at Styles is above suspicion. Anyone could have killed Emily - from her ambitious American husband to her distinguished but troubled sons John and Lawrence, her old friend Evie Howard and young ward Cynthia Murdoch. Captain Hastings is desperate to solve the mystery and protect the family from the terrible speculation of the press. And he knows just the man they need: a brilliant Detective Hastings once knew, who just happens to be staying in the village. His insight and method are exceptional - and his suit is flawless.
