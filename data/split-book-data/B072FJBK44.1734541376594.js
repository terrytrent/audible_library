Hope Takeda, a lab assistant charged with educating and socializing Al, soon discovers that day care is a lot more difficult when your kid is an evolving and easily frightened A.I. </p> <p>When Al manages to access the Internet and escape the lab days before his official unveiling, Hope and her team embark on a mission to contain him - before he causes any real trouble. </p> <p>Soon the NSA is on Al's back, the US Army is fighting a brigade of mass-produced robots, and a wannabe cyberterrorist is looking to silence Al permanently.

Will she manage to control the unruly A.I. and quell a global crisis, or will Al outsmart them once and for all? </p>";
