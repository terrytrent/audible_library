window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Speak So Your Audience Will Listen</i> is an audiobook for anyone who has to deliver a message, tell a story – or speak to another human being. </p> <p>Most of us are quite relaxed and confident when we're with our friends and family. We can tell a story or even tell a joke. But put us on a platform and we can feel very different. When we speak to an audience, we often put on a public mask; and use a different voice. Why can't we seem to be ourselves when we give a talk? </p> <p>In this audiobook, we will look at all aspects of spoken communication, from structure right through to delivery. We will learn how to have a conversation with our audience - to be ourselves - so that we connect with them every time we speak. In seven simple steps, you can learn to be a confident and authentic public speaker. There are specific exercises at the end of every section for you to practice. </p> <p>Whether you're a CEO presenting to shareholders, a manager motivating your team, an entrepreneur selling a business, a creative pitching an idea, a charity worker asking for donations, or a parent speaking at your daughter's wedding, this audiobook will help you become a confident and authentic public speaker – so that when you speak, your audience will listen. </p>";
