He did this by publishing <i>Unfettered</i>, an anthology featuring short stories donated by some of the best science fiction and fantasy writers working today. </p> <p>The fight will not stop there. In an effort to pay forward the aid he received - and to memorialize his mother who passed away from stomach cancer in early 2016 - Speakman has again collaborated with celebrated genre authors to publish <i>Unfettered II</i>. All proceeds from the anthology will either help eliminate medical debt for other authors or be donated to cancer research hubs around the world. </p> <p>Twenty original new tales comprise this amazing collection and, as the title suggests, the writers were again free to contribute whatever they wished. </p> <p>Here is the lineup for <i>Unfettered II</i>: </p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Foreword by Terry Brooks </li> <li>Bradley Beaulieu (Song of Shattered Sands) </li> <li>Jim Butcher (Dresden Files) </li> <li>Rachel Caine </li> <li>Sarah Beth Durst (The Queens of Renthia) </li> <li>David Farland (Runelords) </li> <li>Charlaine Harris </li> <li>Mark Lawrence </li> <li>Erin Lindsey (Bloodbound) </li> <li>Seanan McGuire </li> <li>Aidan Moher </li> <li>Naomi Novik </li> <li>Peter Orullian (Vault of Heaven) </li> <li>J. A. Pitts </li> <li>Anthony Ryan (Raven's Shadow) </li> <li>Brandon Sanderson (Stormlight Archive) </li> <li>Scott Sigler </li> <li>Shawn Speakman (Annwn Cycle) </li> <li>Michael J. Sullivan (The Legends of the First Empire) </li> <li>Django Wexler </li> <li>Janny Wufts (Wars of Light and Shadow) </li> </ul> <p></p> <p>With the help of <i>New York Times</i> best-selling authors as well as talented newcomers, Speakman has taken the platform <i>Unfettered</i> created to not only confront medical debt but to support the battle against one of our gravest illnesses. <i>Unfettered II</i> is a fantastic sequel anthology, but it is more than that; it is proof that we are stronger together than we are apart. </p> <p>After all, isn't that what genre fiction is all about? </p>";
