window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Over the past hundred years, scholars have attacked the historical truth of the Gospels and argued that they were originally anonymous and filled with contradictions. In <i>The Case for Jesus</i>, Brant Pitre taps in to the wells of Christian scripture, history, and tradition to ask and answer a number of different questions, including: If we don't know who wrote the Gospels, how can we trust them? How are the four Gospels different from other Gospels, such as the lost Gospel of \"Q\" and the Gospel of Thomas? How can the four Gospels be historically true when there are differences between them? How much faith should be put into these writings? </p> <p>As <i>The Case for Jesus</i> will show, recent discoveries in New Testament scholarship as well as neglected evidence from ancient manuscripts and the early church fathers together have the potential to pull the rug out from under a century of skepticism toward the apostolic authorship and historical truth of the traditional Gospels. </p>";
