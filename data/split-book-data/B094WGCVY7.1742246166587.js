One day, he encounters a small, furry humanoid whom he names Little Fuzzy, who introduces Holloway to his family. Holloway cares for the Fuzzies and spreads the news of their apparently intelligent behavior. When the Company discovers that the Fuzzies' intelligence may qualify them as a sapient species, it takes certain steps, as sapient life on Zarathustra would change the planet’s status to a protected aboriginal zone, require representative government, and remove the company’s complete control of the planet's resources.<i> Little Fuzzy</i> is an action-packed and thought-provoking listen.</p>";
