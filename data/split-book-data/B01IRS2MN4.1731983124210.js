window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>In this dark and gritty collection - featuring short stories from Jim Butcher, Seanan McGuire, Kevin J. Anderson, and Rob Thurman - nothing is as simple as black and white, light and dark, good and evil....</b> </p> <p><b>Unfortunately, that's exactly what makes it so easy to cross the line.</b> </p> <p>In number-one <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Jim Butcher's \"Cold Case\", Molly Carpenter - Harry Dresden's apprentice-turned-Winter Lady - must collect a tribute from a remote Fae colony and discovers that even if you're a good girl, sometimes you have to be bad. </p> <p><i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Seanan McGuire's \"Sleepover\" finds half-succubus Elsie Harrington kidnapped by a group of desperate teenage boys. Not for anything weird. They just need her to rescue a little girl from the boogeyman. No biggie. </p> <p>In <i>New York Times</i> best-selling Kevin J. Anderson's \"Eye of Newt\", Zombie PI Dan Shamble's latest client is a panicky lizard missing an eye who thinks someone wants him dead. But the truth is that someone only wants him for a very special dinner.... </p> <p>And <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Rob Thurman's infernally heroic Caliban Leandros takes a trip down memory lane as he deals with some overdue - and nightmarish - vengeance involving some quite nasty \"Impossible Monsters\". </p> <p><b>Also includes stories by Tanya Huff, Kat Richardson, Jim C. Hines, Anton Strout, Lucy A. Snyder, Kristine Kathryn Rusch, and Erik Scott de Bie.</b> </p> <p>Full cast of narrators includes Jon Lindstrom, Sumalee Montano, Mozhan Marno, Karissa Vacker, and Macleod Andrews. </p>";
