window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Needle in a Timestack</i> is Robert Silverberg at his very best - intelligent, inventive, and visionary. This collection showcases his talent for thought-provoking science fiction, ranging in themes from time travel to space travel, the media to mortality.</p> <p>In the titular story - under development as a feature film by Oscar-winning screenwriter John Ridley - a jealous ex-husband warps time in a vindictive attempt to destroy his former wife's new marriage. Thirty-one identical sons have a shocking surprise for their mother in \"There Was an Old Woman\". The prophetic \"The Pain Peddlers\" depicts reality TV in a way that allows viewers to revel in a voyeuristic, adrenaline-fueled rush. Also included are Silverberg's Hugo Award-winning \"Enter a Soldier. Later: Enter Another\", and the Locus Award winner \"The Secret Sharer\", a Joseph Conrad-inspired tale of a ship captain drawn into a strange alliance with a stowaway.</p>";
