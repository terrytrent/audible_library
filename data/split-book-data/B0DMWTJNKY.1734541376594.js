window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Amber is a young videographer who has landed her dream job. She is to produce a web series based on a late-night talk radio show dealing with the unexplained. She is a huge fan of the show, and its host, Jack Owens, who she hopes to help reveal the world’s most cryptic secrets. The first secret she reveals is Jack’s. He doesn’t believe any of this crap. To him, the show is just a cushy job that allows him to support himself and his wife without having to try very hard. He doesn’t want to leave his house, go anywhere near the things he’s reported on or the people who come on his show, who he thinks, or at least hopes, are liars. But go near them, he will! And so will you! Join Jack and Amber as they encounter: monstrous creatures, scientific anomalies, shadowy conspiracies, secretive agencies, medical abnormalities, ancient curses, life after death and/or the key to immortality (Yes! Both of those things)! All that, and some really creepy kids! Listen to this book, and you’ll agree, “That’s Not Right.\"</p>";
