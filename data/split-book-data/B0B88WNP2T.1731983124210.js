Bringing up the first baby in Hell will test the parenting skills of the stalwart skeleton and his demonic partner, for Mona is no ordinary child. She soon exhibits powers that would make a devil blanch.</p> <p>The First Baby has her own set of firsts—from words to steps to a hospital visit—and they all unfold in madcap fashion.</p> <p><i>Circles in Hell</i> has been compared to other works of “Hell Fiction” including <i>The Screwtape Letters</i> and <i>Good Omen</i>s and to the paranormal humor of Tom Holt, Christopher Moore, Gary Larson, and Douglas Adams.</p>";
