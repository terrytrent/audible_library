window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>USA Today</i></b><b> bestselling author Nicholas Sansbury Smith comes a brand-new novella set in the world of the Hell Divers series.</b></p> <p>Before you knew him as the king or the Immortal, he was Commander Xavier “X” Rodriguez—with ninety-six dives under his belt, the most experienced Hell Diver on the airship known as the Hive. Time after time, he dived through the electrical storms, returning with parts to keep his home in the sky. Then, on a jump into Hades, the most hostile environment in North America, he sacrificed everything for mission and team. They returned to the airship with the fuel cells needed to keep the Hive running, but X was left behind.</p> <p>This is the story of how he becomes the last man on Earth. His will drives him to keep fighting, to survive the monsters and the radiation in the wastes, to find a way back home. But as the days pass, he feels the things that make him human slipping away. He has become a waif, a phantom, with little to live for. Then he stumbles upon something that makes him feel again.</p> <p>This is the chronicle of those lost years, told for the first time ever.</p>";
