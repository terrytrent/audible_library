window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Listen to the shocking story that the media have ignored and covered up. </p> <p>In 2007, two Israeli news publications, <i>Israel Today</i> and <i>News First Class</i>, reported that the most famous rabbi in Israel's modern history, 108-year-old Yitzhak Kaduri, had left a cryptic death note revealing the name of the long-awaited Messiah. Within a year after the rabbi's death, the note was reported to have been verified as authentic by some of Kaduri's closest followers and then placed on Kaduri's own website (Kaduri.net). The purported Kaduri message proclaimed that Messiah's name was Yehoshua, or Jesus. Its significance shocked the religious world. </p> <p>Shortly thereafter the furor began. The note immediately disappeared from Kaduri's website. The media refused to report further upon the matter. The Kaduri family and several others close to the Kaduri ministry began to claim that the note was a forgery or a mere fabrication - a cruel joke. Now author, senior pastor, radio talk-show host, and former law enforcement officer Carl Gallups, uses his biblical knowledge and journalistic and investigative skills to explore the matter inside and out. Gallup's exciting, detailed reporting reaches startling conclusions that will amaze you. </p>";
