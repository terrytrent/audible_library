window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Containers are revolutionizing the way we build, ship, and run our applications. But like all good things, they come with their own set of challenges. This is where Kubernetes enters the scene.</p> <p>Kubernetes helps you deploy and manage containerized applications at scale. It also abstracts the many different underlying cloud platforms so that you don't need to care whether you're deploying on Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, or your own on-premises datacenter. With Kubernetes, you can develop your applications on your laptop, deploy to your chosen cloud platform, migrate to a different cloud platform, and even migrate to your private cloud at your on-premises datacenter.</p> <p>This audio version of <i>The Kubernetes Book</i> starts from the beginning and covers everything you need to know to be proficient with Kubernetes. It even includes two sections dedicated to threat-modeling Kubernetes and real-world security.</p> <p>You'll learn:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Kubernetes cluster architecture</li> <li>How to build Kubernetes Clusters</li> <li>How to deploy and manage applications on Kubernetes</li> <li>How to secure Kubernetes</li> <li>The meaning of terms like cloud-native, microservices, desired state, containerized, and more...</li> </ul>";
