Rowling's iconic stories is a listening adventure for the whole family.<br> <br> <i>'There will be three tasks, spaced throughout the school year, and they will test the champions in many different ways ... their magical prowess - their daring - their powers of deduction - and, of course, their ability to cope with danger.'</i><br> <br> Close your eyes and enter the magical world of Harry Potter.
