Part soundscape and part bedtime story, <i>The Sleeping World</i> is an intimate journey through ecologies around the world.</p> <p>Dogs are a familiar and comforting part of many of our lives. In this episode, we take a walk with a pet xoloitzcuintli, or Mexican hairless dog, as he greets his blocks by smell. Along the way, we learn the backstory of squirrels in U.S. cities and observe the very smart and clean neighborhood raccoon.</p> <p>This is the world in its natural state, defined by seasons, routines, and cycles. By the time this dog is back home, curled up under a blanket and starting to drift off to the patter of rain, you’ll be ready to drift off too.</p> <p><b><i>Produced by</i></b><i> Audible and Mumble Media<br> </i><b><i>Written by</i></b><i> Cara Ehlenfeldt<br> </i><b><i>Narrated by</i></b><i> Cynthia Kimola <br> </i><b><i>Executive Producers for Mumble Media:</i></b><i> Cara Ehlenfeldt and Jake Young<br> </i><b><i>Executive Producer for Audible:</i></b><i> Anna Stitt <br> </i><b><i>Sound Design and Mix:</i></b><i> Mumble Media<br> </i><b><i>The Mumble Media team</i></b><i> is Jaymeson Catsouphes, Cara Ehlenfeldt, Chester Gwazda, Liz Mak, Lee Mengistu, Renée Vargas, and Jake Young <br> </i><b><i>Dog Consultant:</i></b><i> Dr. Mia Cobb<br> </i><b><i>Fact-Checker:</i></b><i> Andrea López-Cruzado <br> </i><b><i>Head of Creative Development at Audible:</i></b><i> Kate Navin <br> </i><b><i>Chief Content Officer at Audible:</i></b><i> Rachel Ghiazza</i></p> <p>Available in Dolby Atmos on Audible.</p>";
