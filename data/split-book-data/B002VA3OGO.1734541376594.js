window.bookSummaryJSON = "<i>\"It was the year when they finally immanentized the Eschaton\"</i>. <p> So begins this original trilogy of conspiracies, <i>Illuminatus!</i>. For the first time in audiobook form, the unabridged epic is presented in all its grandeur, spookiness, hilarity, and brilliance.</p> <p> The Illuminati, an inside joke? The lunatic fringe? Or a vast conspiracy hidden for centuries, unleashing it's power on a naive, defenseless world? It was the lousy luck of Saul Goodman, a tough, streetwise New York detective, to smell the trail in a bombed-out office - the heavy case he'd always dreaded. In a breakneck race against an awesome deadline, Goodman plunges down the trail of the ultimate conspiracy as the days fall away toward Apocalypse.</p> <p> Filled with sex, violence, and rock-and-roll, in and out of time and space, <i>Illuminatus!</i> is only partly a work of the imagination. The trilogy tackles all the cover-ups of our time, from who really shot the Kennedys to why there's a pyramid on the one-dollar bill, and suggests a mind-blowing truth.</p> <p> <i>Part I: The Eye in the Pyramid</i> is performed by the incomparable Ken Campbell and Chris Fairbank. In 1976, Ken Campbell adapted <i>Illuminatus!</i> for the stage, creating a 10-hour epic that went on to open the Royal National Theatre in London under the patronage of Queen Elizabeth II.</p>";
