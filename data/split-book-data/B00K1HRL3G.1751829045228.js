window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Michael Lewis’ <i>Flash Boys</i> revealed how high-frequency trading has created a ruthless breed of traders capable of winning whichever way the market turns. In <i>Rogue Code</i>, Mark Russinovich takes it one step further to show how their grip on high finance makes the stock market vulnerable to hackers who could bring about worldwide financial collapse. </p> <p>Cyber security expert Jeff Aiken knows that no computer system is completely secure. When he’s called to investigate a possible breach at the New York Stock Exchange, he discovers not only that their system has been infiltrated but that someone on the inside knows. Yet for some reason, they have allowed the hackers to steal millions of dollars from accounts without trying to stop the theft. </p> <p>When Jeff uncovers the crime, the NYSE suddenly turns on him. Accused of grand larceny, he must find and expose the criminals behind the theft, not just to prove his innocence but to stop a multibillion-dollar heist that could upend the U.S. economy. Unwilling to heed Jeff’s warnings, the NYSE plans to continue with a major IPO using a new, untested system, one that might be susceptible both to hackers and to ruthless high-frequency traders willing to take any risk to turn a profit. </p> <p>Now Jeff Aiken must unearth the truth on his own, following the thread to the back alleys of Rio de Janeiro to take on one of the world’s most ruthless cartels. </p> <p>Praised for his combination of real-world technology and quick-paced action, with <i>Rogue Code</i> Mark Russinovich delivers an intense thriller about a cyber threat that seems all too possible - and the Wall Street traders who might allow it to happen. </p> <p>Includes a foreword by Haim Bodek, author of <i>The Problem of HFT: Collected Writings on High Frequency Trading &amp; Stock Market Structure Reform</i>. </p>";
