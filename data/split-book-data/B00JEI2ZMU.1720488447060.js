Now all she has are the newspaper clippings that wallpaper her bedroom, and her recurring nightmares of an all-consuming fire. </p> <p>Not even Emmy's ex-boyfriend, field agent Harrison \"Books\" Bookman, will believe her that hundreds of kidnappings, rapes, and murders are all connected. That is, until Emmy finds a piece of evidence he can't afford to ignore. More murders are reported by the dayâ€”and they're all inexplicable. No motives, no murder weapons, no suspects. Could one person really be responsible for these unthinkable crimes?</p> <p><i>Invisible</i> is James Patterson's scariest, most chilling stand-alone thriller yet. </p>";
