window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Read by the author.</b></p> <p><b>Best-selling and award-winning author Lee Strobel interviews experts about the evidence for the afterlife and offers credible answers to the most provocative questions about what happens when we die, near-death experiences, heaven, and hell. </b></p> <p>We all want to know what awaits us on the other side of death, but is there any reliable evidence that there is life after death? Investigative author Lee Strobel offers a lively and compelling study into one of the most provocative topics of our day. </p> <p>Through fascinating conversations with respected scholars and experts - a neuroscientist from Cambridge University, a researcher who analyzed a thousand accounts of near-death experiences, and an atheist-turned-Christian-philosopher - Strobel offers compelling reasons for why death is not the end of our existence but a transition to an exciting world to come. Looking at biblical accounts, Strobel unfolds what awaits us after we take our last breath and answers questions like:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Is there an afterlife?</li> <li>What is heaven like?</li> <li>How will we spend our time there?</li> <li>And what does it mean to see God face-to-face? </li> </ul> <p>With a balanced approach, Strobel examines the alternative of hell and the logic of damnation and gives a careful look at reincarnation, universalism, the exclusivity claims of Christ, and other issues related to the topic of life after death. With vulnerability, Strobel shares the experience of how he nearly died years ago and how the reality of death can shape our lives and faith. </p> <p>Follow Strobel on this journey of discovery of the entirely credible, believable, and exhilarating life to come.</p> <p>Further reading suggestions, a scripture list, and a study guide are available in the audiobook companion PDF download. </p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b> </p>";
