Part soundscape and part bedtime story, <i>The Sleeping World</i> is an intimate journey through ecologies around the world.</p> <p>Fennec foxes' ears can be up to half as long as their bodies. They use them to track movement across the Sahara Desert, including under the sand. In this episode, we follow a fox as he meanders home to his family through the sand dunes as they slowly shift with the wind.</p> <p>This is the world in its natural state, defined by seasons, routines, and cycles. By the time the fox is nestled with his pups inside a den dug into a dune, ready to doze, you'll be ready to doze too.</p> <p><b><i>Produced by</i></b><i> Audible and Mumble Media<br> </i><b><i>Written by </i></b><i>Fil Corbitt<br> </i><b><i>Narrated by</i></b><i> Cynthia Kimola<br> </i><b><i>Executive Producers for Mumble Media:</i></b><i> Cara Ehlenfeldt and Jake Young<br> </i><b><i>Executive Producer for Audible:</i></b><i> Anna Stitt<br> </i><b><i>Sound Design and Mix:</i></b><i> Mumble Media<br> </i><b><i>The Mumble Media team</i></b><i> is Jaymeson Catsouphes, Cara Ehlenfeldt, Chester Gwazda, Liz Mak, Lee Mengistu, Renée Vargas, and Jake Young<br> </i><b><i>Fact-Checker:</i></b><i> Andrea López-Cruzado<br> </i><b><i>Head of Creative Development at Audible:</i></b><i> Kate Navin<br> </i><b><i>Chief Content Officer at Audible:</i></b><i> Rachel Ghiazza</i></p> <p>Available in Dolby Atmos on Audible.</p>";
