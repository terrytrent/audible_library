Now with all-new illustrations!</b><br><br>Sketcher, adventurer, disguiser, and sneaker Ollister B. Pembrick roamed all of Skree with a sketchbook and pen, searching behind every tree stump and under every stone, in every river and on every hill, to discover and document the endless living wonders of the Maker's world.

Tread carefully, young adventurer. The creatures within are not to be trifled with.<br><br><b>*Includes a downloadable PDF of illustrations from the book</b>";
