But he needs more money. </b></p> <p>His mother’s medical treatment won’t pay for itself, and his father is already working three jobs to try to make ends meet. But it might just be his lucky day: Mr. Edwards has another job for him.</p> <p>It’s more delivery work, but not the usual kind. You might even say that it’s out of this world. Oh well. Beggars can’t be choosers, and the pay is fantastic.</p> <p>Of course, it’s not going to be easy, and he does have to keep the whole thing secret. But come hell or high water, Simon is going to get the job done. It doesn’t matter if it’s warring demons, angry tree-folk, or ornery artificial intelligence, nothing is going to stop him from making his deliveries.</p> <p>He’s not a normal delivery boy anymore—he’s a cosmic delivery boy.</p>";
