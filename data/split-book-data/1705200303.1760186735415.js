Ahren and his companions have to traverse a kingdom plagued by unrest, sail along the treacherous east coast of Jorath and reach the dwarf enclave of Silver Cliff. Falk, Ahren's master hopes to find in its depths the third Einhan, a dwarf friend from his mercenary days, and to win him over for the Ritual of Naming that awaits his apprentice. To gain the dwarf's assistance, they must help him in his solitary watch, that tradition of the little people which allows a dwarf to attain his own individual name. </p> <p>But time is of the essence. Ahren's Appointment as the 13th Paladin - assisted by the three Einhans - must occur by the winter solstice. If not, He, Who Forces will awaken before his time and plunge the unprepared peoples of Jorath into the depths of darkness.</p>";
