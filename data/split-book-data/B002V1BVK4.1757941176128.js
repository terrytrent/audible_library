window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Originally published in 1932, this outstanding work of literature is more crucial and relevant today than ever before.</b></p> <p><b>“One of the most prophetic dystopian works of the 20th century”—</b><b><i>Wall Street Journal</i></b></p> <p>Cloning, feel-good drugs, antiaging programs, and total social control through politics, programming, and media—has Aldous Huxley accurately predicted our future? With a storyteller’s genius, he weaves these ethical controversies in a compelling narrative that dawns in the year 632 AF (After Ford, the deity). When Lenina and Bernard visit a savage reservation, we experience how Utopia can destroy humanity.</p> <p>A powerful work of speculative fiction that has enthralled and terrified readers for generations, <i>Brave New World</i> is both a warning to be heeded and thought-provoking yet satisfying entertainment.</p>";
