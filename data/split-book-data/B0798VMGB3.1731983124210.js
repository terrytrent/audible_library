Along the way, he meets a few new angels and a couple of saints. He even learns what may be one of the great secrets of the universe...or maybe not.</p> <p>And all the while, something’s bothering him.

After all, Steve is no angel. He’s a little bit good, a little bit bad, and a whole lot of trouble!</p> <p><b><i>I’m No Angel</i></b><b> Is the fifth volume in the satire/fantasy comedy series, Circles in Hell.
