That is, until a mission goes wrong, and Baird is infected with a deadly virus. With only seven days to live, Baird has to complete a series of daring missions, each one designed to bring her closer to a cure.</p> <p>Allegedly.</p> <p>Baird suspects the Toolbox might not be telling her the whole truth. She's not sure what to believe or who to trust.</p> <p>And the clock is ticking.</p>";
