Part soundscape and part bedtime story, <i>The Sleeping World</i> is an intimate journey through ecologies around the world.</p> <p>Elephants are the largest land animals in the world. They are also intensely social and have advanced long-term memories. In this episode, a parade of Asian elephants makes its way through the Sri Lankan forest to a lake for drinks and mud baths, stopping periodically for group naps. The female leading the parade uses infrasonic rumbles—inaudible to humans, but traveling as far as two miles along the surface of the Earth as seismic waves—to invite friends and family around the forest to join her at the reservoir.</p> <p>This is the world in its natural state, defined by seasons, routines, and cycles. By the time the elephants are done socializing, covered in fresh mud, and ready to doze again, you’ll be ready to doze too.</p> <p><b><i>Produced by</i></b><i> Audible and Mumble Media<br> </i><b><i>Written by</i></b><i> Sarah Craig<br> </i><b><i>Narrated by</i></b><i> Cynthia Kimola <br> </i><b><i>Executive Producers for Mumble Media:</i></b><i> Cara Ehlenfeldt and Jake Young<br> </i><b><i>Executive Producer for Audible:</i></b><i> Anna Stitt <br> </i><b><i>Sound Design and Mix:</i></b><i> Mumble Media<br> </i><b><i>The Mumble Media team</i></b><i> is Jaymeson Catsouphes, Cara Ehlenfeldt, Chester Gwazda, Liz Mak, Lee Mengistu, Renée Vargas, and Jake Young <br> </i><b><i>Asian Elephant Consultant:</i></b><i> Dr. Prithiviraj Fernando<br> </i><b><i>Fact-Checker:</i></b><i> Andrea López-Cruzado <br> </i><b><i>Head of Creative Development at Audible:</i></b><i> Kate Navin <br> </i><b><i>Chief Content Officer at Audible:</i></b><i> Rachel Ghiazza</i></p> <p>Available in Dolby Atmos on Audible.</p>";
