That most of them are dead is of little consequence, for they possess great powers. Halos and horns, strength and sarcasm, courage and comedy, oh, and a management textbook: This team has them all. They are The League of Unusual Denizens.<br> </p> <p>LOUD: A superhero team par excellence on the ultimate voyage through what is truly the final frontier.<br> </p> <p>LOUD: A stupid acronym, though it fits well on a T-shirt. And this team of misfit heroes will need every advantage if they hope to save the heavens and the earth from returning to Chaos.<br> </p> <p>Here they go, into the breach. Get loud!<br> </p> <p><i>The League of Unusual Denizens</i> Is the eighth volume in the satire/fantasy comedy series, Circles in Hell.
