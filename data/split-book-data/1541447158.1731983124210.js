He describes parenting as \"a million different gears turning in a million different directions, all of them covered in sour milk.\" In this inspiring and unconventional book of essays, he sheds light on the darker yet hilarious side of domestic life.</p> <p>Owning up to all his mishaps and dumbassery, Edwards shares essays on just about every topic fellow spouses and parents can appreciate, including: stupid things he's said to his pregnant wife, the trauma of taking a toddler shopping, revelations on buying a minivan, and the struggle to not fight the nosy neighbor (who is five years old).</p> <p>Clint's funny, heartwarming account of the terrifying yet completely rewarding life of a parent is a breath of fresh air. Each essay in <i>I'm Sorry...Love, Your Husband </i>will have you thinking finally, someone gets it.</p>";
