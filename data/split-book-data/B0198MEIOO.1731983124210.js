You’ll thank me later.” - David Baldacci</p> <p><b>The first in the international bestselling series!</b></p> <p><b>Who is </b><b><i>Orphan X?</i></b></p> <p>The Nowhere Man is a legendary figure spoken about only in whispers. It’s said that when he’s reached by the truly desperate and deserving, the Nowhere Man can and will do anything to protect and save them. But he’s not merely a legend.</p> <p><b>“Excellent...A smart, stylish, state-of-the-art thriller...might give Lee Child’s Jack Reacher books a run for their money.” - </b><b><i>The Washington Post</i></b></p> <p>Evan Smoak is a man with skills, resources, and a personal mission to help those with nowhere else to turn.
