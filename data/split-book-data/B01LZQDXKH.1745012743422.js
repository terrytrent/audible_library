window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>This collection includes all three books in Serena Valentino's Villains trilogy. </p> <p><i>Fairest of All: A Tale of the Wicked Queen</i> </p> <p>Why exactly is the wicked Queen so nasty, particularly to Snow White? Perhaps it has something to do with the creepy-looking man in the magic mirror who's not just some random spooky visage. </p> <p><i>The Beast Within: A Tale of Beauty's Prince</i> </p> <p>A cursed prince sits alone in a secluded castle. Few have seen him, but those who claim they have say his hair is wild and nails are sharp - like a beast's! But how did this prince, once jovial and beloved by the people, come to be a reclusive and bitter monster? And is it possible that he can ever find true love and break the curse that has been placed upon him? </p> <p><i>Poor Unfortunate Soul: A Tale of the Sea Witch</i> </p> <p>The third novel in Serena Valentino's Villains trilogy features the story of the Little Mermaid from the perspective of the sea witch Ursula. </p>";
