window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>You'll never see leadership the same way again after reading this book. </p> <p>These 15 commitments are a distillation of decades of work with CEOs and other leaders. They are radical or provocative for many. They have been game changers for us and for our clients. We trust they will be for you, too. </p> <p>Our experience is that unconscious leadership is not sustainable. It won't work for you, your team, or your organization in the long term. Unconscious leadership can deliver short-term results, but the costs of living and leading unconsciously are great. </p> <p>Fear drives most leaders to make choices that are at odds with healthy relationships, vitality, and balance. This fear leaves a toxic residue that won't be as easily tolerated in an increasingly complex business environment. </p> <p>Conscious leadership offers the antidote to fear. These pages contain a comprehensive road map to guide you to shift from fear-based to trust-based leadership. Once you learn and start practicing conscious leadership, you'll get results in the form of more energy, clarity, focus, and healthier relationships. You'll do more and more of what you are passionate about and less of what you do out of obligation. Your team will get results as well. Drama and gossip will all but disappear, and the energy and resources that fueled them will be redirected towardsinnovation and creativity. </p> <p>Any one of these commitments will change your life. All of them together are revolutionary. </p> <p>What do you need to bring to the table? </p> <p>Be curious. </p> <p>Sounds so simple, yet in our experience it's a skill few have mastered. Most of us are far more interested in being right and proving it than we are in learning, growing, and shifting out of our old patterns. By default we gravitate toward the familiar. We're asking you to take a chance and explore the unfamiliar. </p>";
