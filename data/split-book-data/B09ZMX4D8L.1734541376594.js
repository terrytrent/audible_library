window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>What happened to the ancient Egyptians? When their civilization fell, did the Egyptian people disappear? Or do their descendants exist to this day? What about the ancient Persians? Romans? Mayans?</p> <p>For years, the answers to these questions have been hidden. But no more. Nathaniel T. Jeanson, a Harvard graduate with a PhD in cell and developmental biology, has discovered a DNA-based, generation by generation family tree for global humanity. This tree uncovers the origin and fate of these ancient peoples—and connects them to peoples alive today.</p> <p>The fascinating research presented in <i>Traced</i> has additional far-reaching consequences for numerous contemporary debates:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Race: <i>Traced</i> shows that the races have changed multiple times in human history. Thus, “White”, “Black”, “Asian” and other common descriptors lose their meaning in light of modern genetics.</li> <li>Prehistory: <i>Traced </i>reveals that today’s Native Americans were not the first but replaced earlier inhabitants whose genealogical origins remain unknown.</li> <li>History and origin of minority groups: The genetics in <i>Traced</i> restores the indigenous histories to many obscure people groups and connects them back to specific ancestors in Genesis 10.</li> <li>The age of the Earth: <i>Traced</i> represents one of the strongest arguments in print for the recent origin of humanity.</li> <li>Biblical authority: Historically, young-Earth creationists have sought to defend biblical authority from scientific attacks; <i>Traced</i> puts biblical authority on offense.</li> </ul> <p>Dive into the wild and emerging field of historical genetics and see how these recent discoveries on the fate of ancient civilizations end up uncovering the story of the whole world. <i>Traced: Human DNA’s Big Surprise</i> will inspire, not only budding historians, archaeologists, geneticists, linguists, and anthropologists, but anyone interested the marvelous and messy story of humankind.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
