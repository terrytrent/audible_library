Part soundscape and part bedtime story, <i>The Sleeping World</i> is an intimate journey through ecologies around the world.</p> <p>Platypuses are mammals unlike any other on earth. They lay eggs, ooze milk through their skin, and can sense electricity. In this episode, we travel with a platypus as he moves through his nightly routine on the island of Tasmania. He uses electroreceptors to hunt underwater and does a synchronized swimming courtship ritual with his mate, who then digs a burrow 40 feet deep into the riverbank to nest.</p> <p>This is the world in its natural state, defined by seasons, routines, and cycles. By the time these platypuses are curled up in their burrows and ready to rest, you’ll be ready to rest too.</p> <p><b><i>Produced by</i></b><i> Audible and Mumble Media<br> </i><b><i>Written by</i></b><i> Fil Corbitt<br> </i><b><i>Narrated by</i></b><i> Cynthia Kimola<br> </i><b><i>Executive Producers for Mumble Media:</i></b><i> Cara Ehlenfeldt and Jake Young<br> </i><b><i>Executive Producer for Audible:</i></b><i> Anna Stitt<br> </i><b><i>Sound Design and Mix:</i></b><i> Mumble Media<br> </i><b><i>The Mumble Media team</i></b><i> is Jaymeson Catsouphes, Cara Ehlenfeldt, Chester Gwazda, Liz Mak, Lee Mengistu, Renée Vargas, and Jake Young<br> </i><b><i>Platypus Consultant:</i></b><i> Geoff Williams<br> </i><b><i>Fact-Checker:</i></b><i> Andrea López-Cruzado<br> </i><b><i>Head of Creative Development at Audible:</i></b><i> Kate Navin<br> </i><b><i>Chief Content Officer at Audible:</i></b><i> Rachel Ghiazza</i></p> <p>Available in Dolby Atmos on Audible.</p>";
