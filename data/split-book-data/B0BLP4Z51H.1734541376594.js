He’s just not sure, though, what “more” even means in his case.</p> <p>To break out of his funk, he and the other devils pit themselves against their heavenly counterparts in a struggle with universal consequences. No, this isn’t the War in Heaven. It is</p> <p>The Demiurge Competition</p> <p>There can be but one winner, and the Earl of Hell will do everything in his power to ensure that he comes out on top.</p> <p>Join Satan and all your other favorite characters in one final romp through the <i>Circles in Hell</i> universe.
