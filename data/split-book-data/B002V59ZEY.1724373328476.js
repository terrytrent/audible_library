window.bookSummaryJSON = "\"Make me beautiful.\" That's what Marci wants from the old woman, not \"inner beauty\", but real, physical attractiveness to save her from being a teenage outcast. The woman offers a gift in the form of a story, a strange tale from 1940s Bosnia about a group of soldiers who terrorize a town of women and children, brutalize their priest, and murder a child. Somehow, in the midst of the horror, a window opens to another reality, a world of impossible beauty, infectious music, irresistible laughter, and a vision that somehow changes everything. <p> By the time the story ends, Marci hears the heavenly music herself. So will you. Once you hear this unforgettable story, you'll never be the same.</p>";
