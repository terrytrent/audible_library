window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>In the third installment of The End series, Joshua Jordan remains in Israel during his self-imposed exile out of the reach of U.S. authorities who have trumped-up false criminal treason charges against him.</b></p> <p>Joshua Jordan stands accused of treason. The charges paint him as a domestic terrorist who used his own defense-contracting firm and the Roundtable group to infiltrate the Department of Defense and manipulate America's national-security apparatus so it would conform to his own political agenda. Joshua has taken asylum in Israel until his wife and attorney, Abigail, can prove his innocence and guarantee him a fair trial.</p> <p>Following the nuclear attack by Russia, Israel has been cleaning up the bodies of dead enemy soldiers for 7 months and setting out on its 7-year plan—both per the prophecies in Ezekiel. As corruption in high government offices threaten to block the election of a worthy presidential candidate by all means necessary—including the unthinkable—Israel’s leadership is tempted to sign a “peace” proposal initiated by the UN under the authority of Coliquin. Joshua is convinced Coliquin may well be the prophesied Anti-Christ and that his peace plan is a trap to destroy Israel.</p> <p>Are the recurring dreams Joshua is having about the coming rapture from God? And is the end sooner than anyone expects?</p> <p>From <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Tim LaHaye, creator and co-author of the world-renowned Left Behind books, and Craig Parshall, this epic series chronicles the earth-shattering events leading up to the Apocalypse foretold in Revelation.</p> <ul> <li>Futuristic Christian suspense</li> <li>The third installment of The End series<br> Book 1: <i>Edge of Apocalypse<br> </i>Book 2: <i>Thunder of Heaven<br> </i>Book 3: <i>Brink of Chaos<br> </i>Book 4: Mark of Evil</li> </ul>";
