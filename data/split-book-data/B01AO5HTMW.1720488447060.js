window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>With such compelling and provocative novels as <i>Red Planet Blues</i>, <i>FlashForward</i>, and The WWW Trilogy, Robert J. Sawyer has proven himself to be \"a writer of boundless confidence and bold scientific extrapolation\" (<i>The New York Times</i>). Now, the Hugo and Nebula Award-winning author explores the thin line between good and evil that every human being is capable of crossing.... </p> <p>Experimental psychologist Jim Marchuk has developed a flawless technique for identifying the previously undetected psychopaths lurking everywhere in society. But while being cross-examined about his breakthrough in court, Jim is shocked to discover that he has lost his memories of six months of his life from 20 years previously - a dark time during which he himself committed heinous acts. </p> <p>Jim is reunited with Kayla Huron, his forgotten girlfriend from his lost period and now a quantum physicist who has made a stunning discovery about the nature of human consciousness. As a rising tide of violence and hate sweeps across the globe, the psychologist and the physicist combine forces in a race against time to see if they can do the impossible - change human nature - before the entire world descends into darkness. </p>";
