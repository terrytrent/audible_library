It is an exuberant, uniquely American exploration of the passions that make us human—and one of those rare books that renew the idea of what a novel can do.<br> <br> <b>\"The next step in fiction...Edgy, accurate, and darkly witty...Think Beckett, think Pynchon, think Gaddis. Think.\" </b>—<b>Sven Birkerts, </b><b><i>The Atlantic</i></b></p>";
